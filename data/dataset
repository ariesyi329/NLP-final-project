VRent this film now on Film4oD\u000a \u000aIf anyone's going to succeed in demonstrating how fresh-faced recruits can be reduced to machines during military training, it's Stanley Kubrick, a director not known for warm, fuzzy portrayals of humanity.
p86
tp87
a(I0
VWeirdly, by delivering this message so unflinchingly, Full Metal Jacket emerges as one of Kubrick's most engaging films, never letting us forget precisely what its lead characters have lost.
p88
tp89
a(I0
VFollowing a perfunctory title card, we get straight down to business with a montage of recruits getting their heads shaved in no-nonsense fashion.
p90

a(I0
VGiven Kubrick's reputation for endless retakes, it's a wonder this scene didn't take several years as actors waited for their hair to grow back.
p92
tp93
a(I0
VSignificantly, we're given no character backstory, no call-up papers, tearful farewells or lonely sunsets - our first glimpse of the leads is two rows of identical bald bodies with Sergeant Hartman (real-life marine drill instructor Ermey) barking out his intention of breaking the men down, while employing an impressive lexicon of florid insults.
p94
tp95
a(I0
VAll of this establishes the film's atmosphere as nightmarish black comedy, dispelling comparisons with its more ponderous contemporary Platoon.
p96
tp97
a(I0
VErmey's performance as the foul-mouthed Hartman is justly celebrated and it's difficult to imagine the film working anything like as effectively without him.
p98

VModine's Joker (most of the characters are referred to solely by nicknames in a further de-humanising touch) is the film's focus, maintaining a sarcastic attitude throughout while being constantly aware of the horrendous situation he's living through.
p102
tp103
a(I0
VIt's a considerable achievement that Joker can flip between appalling John Wayne impersonations and potentially toe-curling mediations such as "the dead know only one thing: it is better to be alive," while remaining a consistent, believable character.Despite assurances from those involved in its making that Full Metal Jacket was subject to Kubrick's typically extended shooting schedule and attention to detail, there's a willingness to move things along with none of the leisurely pacing that can make a viewing of 2001 or Barry Lyndon such a daunting prospect.
p104

VInstead, the recruits' cliched transformation via montage into a team of precision drilled troops is rapidly turned around, provoking a sense of despair rather than triumph; their journey accompanied by a selection of crude, sex-based call-and-response marching songs as opposed to Survivor's 'Eye Of The Tiger'.

VAdmittedly, the ploy works a treat (the grey English sky is unmistakable, an effect which makes the battlefield appear unearthly) and the first sign that we're in Blighty comes when the British film industry's favourite Yank in residence, Bruce Boa - famous for demanding a Waldorf salad in 'Fawlty Towers' - crops up, demanding to know why Joker wears a peace badge while his helmet bears the legend 'Born to Kill'.

p131
tp132
a(I0
VOne, a torture scene with a vice, has been rightly condemned as gratuitous - but it is the closing beating that truly disturbs, two men brutally disfigured by repeated whacks with metallic bats that, as they are tipped into the grave, their featureless faces frozen in a contorted howl, it's almost as if a new species has emerged from the violence, only to be suddenly, cruelly, aborted.

VYet in Pan's Labyrinth, the world of Ofélia's imagination and the realities of Falangist Spain run in curious parallel as two different, ideologically opposed ways of telling the same story - a story of tyranny, resistance and the timeless struggle between good and evil.Ofélia's trials may be fanciful, but the woodland strife, mythical beasts, heroic acts, purloined keys, forbidden feasts and troubled births that constitute their essential furniture all reflect, through a glass darkly, the actual conflicts taking place around her, while the deadly reality of the dangers faced by the girl and others is never in any doubt.

VFrom Cronos to Mimic to Blade II to Hellboy, Del Toro has always been associated with horror, but even if Pan's Labyrinth has its fair share of grotesquerie, brutality and visceral shocks, it is a film unbounded by genre, all at once children's fantasy, adult parable, historical drama and more, located at a magical crossroads where Labyrinth meets The Shining and Land And Freedom meets Ichi The Killer.

VThe pulsating action coincides exactly with the 85 minutes' running time, as well as brilliantly setting the marshal in isolation among the ominous wooden buildings and dusty streets of a small frontier town.It was the high point of Fred Zinnemann's career, and Gary Cooper, in his Oscar-winning role - at 51, his handsome face lined and drawn - gives possibly the most poignant and profound performance to be found in any western.No doubt Sergio Leone remembered the movie (in which Leone star Van Cleef makes his debut) when he embarked on his homages to the American West, while Ennio Morricone has echoed the effective use of the 'Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling' song on the soundtrack.

p2817

VThat comes despite the fact that it appears to have all the right ingredients: a director with bona fides in drawing a solid film from society\u2019s racial past (The Help), a lead actor with the chops to handle a major transformation (Chadwick Boseman, who also played baseball\u2019s barrier-breaker Jackie Robinson in the biopic 42), and a producer who was an associate of the figure in question (Mick Jagger).

VThe Godfather of Soul is a complicated figure\u2014evinced by his many, many nicknames\u2014and it was always going to be nearly impossible to take a man best known for transcending stages and capture his essence between the four sides of a big screen.

tp2830
a(I0
VHe cultivated a huge number of backing musicians who went on to be prominent artists; he was a generous and largely kind-hearted man to his friends, family and children; he was a creative genius with a massive ego that was frankly well-earned, helping to birth rap music with his 1969 Funky Drummer being the most sampled beat in hip-hop; he was a racial conciliator who, in one of Get On Up\u2018s finest scenes, arguably prevented Boston from rioting in the immediate wake of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s death.

VBut he was also a brutal tyrant to his band, who rode on a bus as he took a plane, and he fined them for their mistakes, with his points and hand gestures on stage doubling as notation of band error.
p2833
tp2834

VHe regularly used PCP and cocaine, a hard-drug problem that was only passingly alluded to in the film by a single shot of Brown rolling cocaine into a cigarette after a personal tragedy.
p2835
tp2836
a(I0
VHis relationship with rap was complicated, but not more so than his positions on race: he revered senator Strom Thurmond\u2014who ran for president as a Dixiecrat, to oppose desegregation\u2013saying that he was \u201clike a grandfather.\u201d In the film, racial differences and inequality are largely reduced to punchlines.

VHe was the Hardest Working Man in Show Business.
p2839

VThat comes with a price\u2014but so much of the film implies that his life and career was essentially an easy coronation, when the reality was so different.
p2841
tp2842
a(I0
VInstead of showing his frustrations with a label who refused to give him any meaningful creative control in the early \u201960s, forcing him into the groundbreaking tactics of starting his own label and distribution firm, Get On Up makes it feel like it was an easy fait accompli that he was able to pull off.
p2843
tp2844

VHe had to push to get heard, push to have his unique sound succeed, and at times push away the people he cared for the most, which can help explain the wild, sad descent of his later years\u2014little of which was represented by the film.

VIt\u2019s not nearly as bad as Wired\u2014the gonzo retelling of the life of John Belushi, curiously told through the perspective of Watergate newsman/Belushi biographer Bob Woodward\u2014but Get On Up frames its story by starting with an inexplicable opening scene of him brandishing a shotgun in an office (details largely fictionalized); Boseman\u2019s Brown even breaks the fourth wall at least three times, which is so rarely a good decision.

VIt may be the biggest saving grace of Get On Up: the fact that Boseman is a more than capable Brown imitator, embodying his tics, his growl, his bouffant hair, that regal chin, his assuredness in his body\u2019s electric motions, his supreme swagger.
p2875

VAnd if it was, it might not need this end title card that comes up at the film\u2019s conclusion: \u201cJames Brown was considered one of the most popular artists of all time.\u201d Anyone with zero knowledge of James Brown leaves the film without a meaningful sense of just how hard Brown really worked, just how hard it was for Brown to wrest creative control, just how low things got before his late-life renaissance, and just how deeply Brown\u2019s influence is still felt today on pop culture, in the disco, funk and rap genres he helped birth as well as on modern performers\u2019 stagecraft.

p3122

VWhere once Andy was a six-year-old boy, adoringly playing with his favourite toys, now he's a young man, poised to leave for college.
p3124

VAndy decides to take Woody with him to college and store the rest of the crew - Buzz, Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Mr Potato Head (Don Rickles), Mrs Potato Head (Estelle Harris), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and co - in the attic.

p3140
tp3141
a(I0
VFortunately, they escape and, believing Andy has rejected them, climb into a box for the daycare centre, and Woody catches up and joins them.When they arrive at "Sunnyside", all seems blissful - they're greeted warmly by the leader of the toys, Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) and there are plenty of kids to play with them.
p3142
tp3143
a(I0
VWoody doesn't give up on Andy so easily though, so he escapes, and is picked up by a little girl called Bonnie.
p3144
tp3145
a(I0
VThe others, meanwhile, discover all is not as it seems at Sunnyside - as new arrivals they're put in the pre-school room, where they're brutally "chewed, kicked, drooled on" by toddlers who haven't reached the stage of imaginative play yet.
p3146
tp3147
a(I0
VSunnyside is basically a prison for the toys, and Lotso isn't a benign patriarch, he's a bitter "Mr Big" type.
p3148

VBetween them, and Pixar's enormously talented crew of designers, animators, visual effects people etc, they've crafted a film that's funny, moving, sentimental and insightful, as it maps a human life, human relationships - specifically a boy leaving home, a mother's bond with that boy - through the medium of sentient plastic toys.

a(I0
VOh, and if you're a Ghibli fan, the Japanese studio's long-term relationship with Pixar is acknowledged by a nice nod here - among Bonnie's toys is a Totoro, the cuddly yet formidable forest spirit from 1988's My Neighbour Totoro\u000a.

a(I0
VIf Robarts is confident of proving his man's innocence, he's as surprised as anyone when Vole's wife Christine (Dietrich) sides not with her spouse but with Torin Thatcher's prosecuting attorney.Christie, Laughton, Dietrich, Power, Wilder - there was no shortage of talent involved in bringing Witness For The Prosectuion to the big screen.

VEven amongst so many other great performances (Dietrich is particularly good as the ice-cold Christine), Laughton still stands out.

p3203
tp3204
a(I0
VFor while Robarts is wonderful fun, the gravity and girth Laughton brings to the part means we're never able to forget that, for all the grandstanding, Sir Wilfrid is giving what might well be his last performance.

V\u000aMichel Gondry's first collaboration with contemporary Hollywood's most original screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, was 2001's Human Nature, a film that never received a theatrical release in the UK and sat in unfavourable comparison with the films the writer made with Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation).
p3212
tp3213
a(I0
VUndeniably, Human Nature was a disappointment - primarily because it didn't capture the genius Gondry had displayed in his innovative, inventive pop promos for the likes of Björk, Massive Attack, Daft Punk and Kylie Minogue.

p3220

tp3241
a(I0
VDesperately, trapped in his own unconscious, Joel tries to stop the destruction of his memories.
p3242
tp3243
a(I0
VIt's the combination of a framing narrative, set in the real world, and the action that takes place within Joel's mind (which skitters around as our hero tries to escape deeper into his memory) that gives Kaufman and Gondry's film its most marked idiosyncrasy.
p3244
tp3245
a(I0
VAs well as offering Kaufman's requisite look at the boundaries of fantasy and reality, it's also perfect for Gondry's own brand of distinctive storytelling ploys, employing some wonderfully lo-fi but amazingly clever trickery.
p3246
tp3247
a(I0
VOverlapping and cross-cutting have been a mainstay of his video work - a camera browsing round a tower block for Massive Attack's 'Protection', Kylie encountering versions of herself for 'Come Into My World', Dave Grohl segueing in and out of dreams for 'Everlong'.
p3248
tp3249
a(I0
VThe devices he created and expertly exploited in the promos are expanded and honed for Eternal Sunshine, creating a unique feel as he realises Kaufman's non-chronological, consciousness/unconsciousness-inhabiting script.
p3250
tp3251
a(I0
VHowever, there's a lot more to the film than technique.
p3252
tp3253
a(I0
VArguably, this is Kaufman's most humane work yet, presenting genuine emotional circumstances within its bizarre, semi-sci-fi scenario.
p3254
tp3255
a(I0
VThere's a moving realism to Joel and Clem's romance and the problems they face in their relationship - ordinary stuff like settling into routines, communicating in different ways, being distanced by things unsaid, as well as the heavier implications of mental illness.
p3256
tp3257
a(I0
VHuman Nature was arguably overwhelmed by its wackiness, and even Being John Malkovich is unsubtle in comparison with Eternal Sunshine.
p3258

VFor twelve years Richard Linklater has been shooting episodically, striking gold all over the place in the process \u2013 most notably in the form of Ellar Coltrane, whose lead performance as Mason is what this ambitious project hinges upon.
p3450

VFollowing Mason from childhood through adolescence, Boyhood doesn\u2019t just capture this young man\u2019s physical and personal growth, but that of the key figures that orbit him: separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke); sister (Lorelei Linklater); and first love (Zoe Graham).
p3452
tp3453
a(I0
VWhile Arquette\u2019s performance is a standout, Linklater conjures emotive, naturalistic performances from all his cast, so as the film works its magic and the years pass by, one can\u2019t help but be captivated by the lives unfolding onscreen.
p3454

VThe boy\u2019s aging is marked as much by the acne flecking his face as by progressing pop cultural references (Dragonball Z, Harry Potter, Halo) and political movements (Bush\u2019s Fallujah invasion, the Obama-Biden ticket).

p3491

VRichard Linklater, director of the peerless Before triptych (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight) has here hit upon a no-brainer conceit that all but renders its generic compatriots obsolete.
p3518
tp3519
a(I0
VBut the magic of Boyhood's high concept behind-the-scenes idea - to reform the cast and crew periodically over 12 years, thereby crafting a literal, \u2018before your very eyes\u2019 type of coming-of-age movie - lies in the many ways that Linklater harnesses the period and passing of time into his very unique project.
p3520
tp3521
a(I0
VBoyhood drops in on Mason (Ellar Coltrane) roughly once every few months over the course of a dozen years, seeing him grow from kid to teen to adult alongside his separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke), his sister (Linklater\u2019s daughter, Lorelei) and a supporting cast of friends and step-family.
p3522
tp3523
a(I0
VTo start, Coltrane is not a precocious child actor, cutting more of an unassuming, naturalistic figure in early scenes of sky-gazing and rock-collecting; but over the years Mason grows from shy kid into a bona fide Linklater youth, the sort the director nailed in Dazed & Confused and Slacker, always ready with a laconic stare and a rambling philosophical rant.
p3524
tp3525
a(I0
VAs with most real-life kids, though, Mason\u2019s world is framed, shaped and structured by his parents, but watching the years melt away puts the audience in a unique spot, so that when he finally, in his teens, starts to develop a life of his own - and he receives his own Linklater-trademark backwards tracking shot (think: almost every walking-and-talking scene in the Before trilogy) - we\u2019re the proud family members, amazed at how quickly he\u2019s grown up.
p3526

VMason may be our anchor, but characters, themes and settings grow along with him, making this film just as much a Parenthood (Arquette\u2019s character\u2019s progression from  thirty-something single mum to successful middle-aged academic could easily be a film in its own right) or, if we\u2019re on a literal title kick, American Family, as the States\u2019 own social landscape shifts in the background of the drama, thrown into sharp relief by Linklater\u2019s episodic, observational style.
p3530
tp3531
a(I0
VFrom Halo to Wii Sports, from iMacs to iPhones, from Britney Spears to Lady Gaga, Boyhood is a survey of 21st-century mainstream pop culture touchstones that, due to the very nature of its production, falls somewhere between the historical and the contemporary.
p3532
tp3533
a(I0
VAnd as Linklater incorporates the War in Afghanistan, the groundswell of idealism that greeted Obama\u2019s first term in office, and eventually the recession, he reveals that while these events and trends may seem discrete on reflection, in reality they happen in quick succession, or sometimes all at once.
p3534

V\u000a\u000a\u000aRon Howard\u2019s Rush is an exuberant, diverting dramatisation of the legendary rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) over the course of the fateful Grand Prix season of 1976.
p3643
tp3644
a(I0
VIts combo of hair-raising behind-the-wheel action, heated off-track controversies and stormy relationship soap is hardly earth-shattering stuff, but Howard and writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) do squeeze sufficient dramatic tension out of the opponents\u2019 wildly different temperaments, while acknowledging their shared sense of purpose and conviction.
p3645
tp3646
a(I0
VHunt is the blonde-and-blue-eyed Brit, a hard-partying, hot-headed playboy with raw driving talent to spare; Lauda, on the other hand, is a brusquely pragmatic Austrian who doesn\u2019t have time for social frivolities, single-mindedly focused on the race to a fault.

VTechnically, Howard doesn\u2019t do anything that John Frankenheimer didn\u2019t already achieve with Grand Prix back in 1966, but some of it sure is dang pretty: armed with Dogme veteran/regular Danny Boyle cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, Rush\u2019s racing sequences are gussied up with expressionistic splashes of hot, saturated colour that heighten the nerve-rattling, feverishly adrenalised view from inside the cockpit.

VThe Hunt and Lauda feud that ran throughout the 1976 season is a goldmine for Morgan, presenting him as it does with two almost diametrically opposed personalities \u2013 and yet, with each as fascinating as the other, and both equally able to inspire empathy alongside disapproval, the script never resorts to painting one as the hero or villain.

VMirroring its twisty, turny plot that tracks the disappearance of \u2018Amazing\u2019 Amy Dunne and the suspicion that falls upon her husband Nick in the aftermath, Gone Girl delivers one rug pull after another as Fincher flits from genre to genre with a reckless abandon.
p4206
tp4207
a(I0
VStarting out as a straightforward mystery before transitioning into thriller territory and then finally warping into a twisted black comedy in its tour de force final act, it\u2019s also by turns a crime drama, erotic thriller and a suburban/economic/media satire along the way.
p4208

VPike and Affleck are both perfectly cast as Nick and Amy, the often inscrutable protagonists of the piece, and the first half of the film follows Nick and the investigation into Amy\u2019s disappearance in the present day, while flashbacks narrated by Amy in the form of diary entries recount the history of their relationship.

V\u000a\u000a\u000aDeparting from the battle royale format of the two previous Hunger Games instalments, Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 plunges the franchise into deeper terrain.
p4497
tp4498
a(I0
VFiguratively, with the pic continuing Katniss Everdeen\u2019s trauma-fuelled mental disintegration and its subject matter becoming bleaker and more violent, as well as the literally underground setting in which much of Mockingjay\u2019s talk of revolution plays out.
p4499
tp4500
a(I0
VAgainst this deep bunker backdrop the cast spend a lot of time sporting unflattering jumpsuits and talking about what is to come in the next chapter, truncated storytelling that hampers this working as a standalone pic.
p4501
tp4502
a(I0
VYes, there is plenty of narrative to work through, and the performances and events that unfold deserve the breathing space that splitting Mockingjay into two films allows.
p4503
tp4504
a(I0
VBut that makes for all build-up and little payoff, lacking a blockbuster set piece finale (even as it tries to make the most of a rebellion skirmish and an aerial commando raid).
p4505
tp4506
a(I0
VThankfully there\u2019s an emotional climax, a cliffhanger that\u2019s less deflating than that of Catching Fire and will further enthuse the audience to see Part 2 - not that they really need any assistance at this point.
p4507
tp4508
a(I0
VDirector Francis Lawrence continues his knack for avoiding obvious, emotionally overwrought moments, something he\u2019s aided considerably in by Lawrence\u2019s expectedly excellent performance.

VThe whole franchise has benefited immensely from the inner turmoil she brings to life, and no more so than here.

V\u000aThe most enduring image The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 offers is an eyeball-searing hell-scape of incinerated corpses, their ribs poking through blackened, immolated flesh.
p4520
tp4521
a(I0
VThis is not Harry Potter, this is not the Twilight saga - The Hunger Games is here to offer an in-your-face critique of the abuse of power and neither the characters nor the material is about to shy away from the issues.
p4522
tp4523
a(I0
VBoth book and film understand and want show their audience that contemporary wars are fought as much through media as they are on the battlefield.
p4524
tp4525
a(I0
VOr rather, while wars have always been fought through the media, these days the media is also in the thick of the actual fight: cameras can be sent out unobtrusively into the field to capture "the truth," though it is of course still in the interpretation of these truths that hearts and minds are won and lost.
p4526
tp4527
a(I0
VAs the film opens, we pick up with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), furious that the rebel alliance led by President Coin (a frosty Julianne Moore) plotted to save her from the Hunger Games at the expense of her more expendable companions.
p4528
tp4529
a(I0
VThey counter that she is their mascot - the emblem of the revolution; they needed her to survive.
p4530
tp4531
a(I0
VAs she refuses to co-operate, they realize they also need her good will.
p4532
tp4533
a(I0
VThe majority of the film is about negotiating that co-operation and how to play it on camera once they finally have her onside.
p4534
tp4535
a(I0
VThe script, by Peter Craig and Danny Strong (Buffy fans may recognise Strong for his onscreen work as nerdy Jonathan Levinson), has a lot of fun with Katniss Everdeen's legendary awkwardness.
p4536
tp4537
a(I0
VPlutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman in his last role) attempts to media train Katniss into a serviceable mouth-piece for their cause, leading to comic scenes of desperation as he and his team realise quite what a dud screen presence she is when asked to play-act the revolution.
p4538
tp4539
a(I0
VIt's a smart excuse for the narrative to take Katniss out to where the action is, which is also what we want as an audience: we need action, even if it is all being staged for our benefit.
p4540
tp4541
a(I0
VIt's hard to shake the feeling that this film doesn't have a particularly cinematic arc, and that this is partly a consequence of carving two films out of one book.
p4542
tp4543
a(I0
VThere is a lot to get through in that third book, but much of it is internal and emotional, to do with how Katniss wrestles with everything that is demanded of her and with her feelings for Peeta, who is mostly restricted to brief onscreen glimpses as the Capitol cranks out its own propaganda making use of their most influential hostage.
p4544
tp4545
a(I0
VThese brief glimpses of Peeta, Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) and President Snow (Donald Sutherland having more fun than anyone else in the film) really do pop - if only there were more of them.
p4546
tp4547
a(I0
VPerhaps it proves Suzanne Collins' satirical point that the absence of the Capitol in this instalment is so keenly felt.
p4548
tp4549
a(I0
VThe world of Panem is named for the Latin tag "panem et circenses": the idea of using "bread and circuses" to distract a population from their lack of real freedom by giving them a glittering show.
p4550
tp4551
a(I0
VWe're so used to blockbusters on this scale delivering precisely that show, it's a little disconcerting to realise that you have indeed been conditioned to miss it when it's left out in favour of something more ideologically sound.

VWe want more of the decadent Capitol and their razzle dazzle; the revolution is a little sombre.
p4554

tp4572
a(I0
VThe title refers to the street that separates Detroit's affluent white neighbourhoods from its poor black ones and Hanson - by way of Amores Perros cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto's fluid-but-raw hand-held work - brilliantly captures the chaos of a once great industrial city gone to ruin.

p4583
tp4584
a(I0
VOn the surface it's a hip-hop Rocky, but while the subtext of Stallone's film was about putting a smart-talking black man - namely Muhammad Ali - in his place, 8 Mile is about defusing racial tension and focussing attention on the economic deprivation that intensifies division.

VHammy camera-hogging some might cry, but since that's the order of the day here, Pitt's efforts blend seamlessly with Mike Myers' seedy British General Ed Fenech, Diane Kruger's Dietrich-esque Bridget Von Hammersmark, and Eli Roth's muscle-bound, baseball bat-wielding Donny Donowitz.

VChristopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is an annihilating experience, especially if you watch it in the enormous IMAX theatre, a vertiginous phenomenon at the best of times; when that eight storey screen fills up with the scarred, sweating, greasepaint-smeared face of Heath Ledger's Joker, speaking of chaos and the cannibalism lurking under civilisation, the temptation is to run screaming into the night.
p4653
tp4654

p4657
tp4658
a(I0
VThat's hyperbole, sure.

p4661

a(I0
VThe screenplay written by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, with additions to the story from David S Goyer, synthesizes crucial elements from two of the greatest Batman comics, Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns' and Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke'.
p4663
tp4664
a(I0
VFrom Miller's groundbreaking portrait of an ageing Batman, the screenplay inherits the malign influence of a masked vigilante upon society, and what demons are unleashed as an unintended consequence of the thrilling psychic and social disorder inspired by a Batman.
p4665
tp4666
a(I0
VFrom 'The Killing Joke' it extracts Moore's Joker, a connoisseur of insanity, visiting the same madness that led to his creation upon our heroes.

VCould Batman be the new Caesar?
p4671
tp4672
a(I0
VThe Dark Knight puts us through the wringer on this one, toying with fascism as a way out of the endless fear and crime before showing, at its close, that even the best of men would be corrupted by the responsibility of being judge, jury and executioner.
p4673
tp4674
a(I0
VChristopher Nolan's first pass at this material was Batman Begins in 2005, a dark and gloomy movie, no doubt, but it needed a dose of the Scarecrow's psychedelic poison to set the citizens of Gotham at one another's throats.

a(I0
VThis time, Heath Ledger's Joker drips fear and disorder into the body politic and the results are far more disturbing.
p4677

VLedger tragically died after filming was completed, and the premature death of such a coruscating talent contributes a terrible urgency to his performance, rubbing away at your knowledge that the actor was just messing around.
p4679
tp4680
a(I0
VWith his lank unwashed green hair, hunched shoulders and restless tongue, always drawing back the saliva from the scars at the corner of his smile, this Joker is all our fears of the amoral urban dispossessed (he likes his knife crime) multiplied by our terror of the suicide bomber, the killer who cannot be reasoned with, the murderer who wants nothing but our destruction.
p4681

V'Solution' is the key term here, as Interstellar reveals that, while Christopher Nolan may court comparisons to the likes of cosmic auteurs Stanley Kubrick (2001) and Terrence Malick (The Tree Of Life), his big scientific and philosophical questions are rarely left unanswered, even when they touch on themes better left just out of comprehension's reach.

p6087
tp6088
a(I0
VIf we hadn't seen Spider-Man onscreen for decades, then perhaps the refresher would be necessary - but it's hard to shake the feeling that the major beats (outsider nerd, loving adoptive family, mutated spider bite, avoidable ironic tragedy) are iconic enough that they could have been dispensed with in an opening montage.

tp6090
a(I0
VThe changes - flashbacks to Peter's parents, a revamped Aunt and Uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen, safe hands in slightly under-serving roles), and a new reason for Peter to visit the fateful Oscorp laboratory - are nuanced rather than dramatically game-changing.But from the moment Spider bites Man, this new take comes alive - and as the deviations from both the comic book source material and Raimi's films grow, it's hard to deny that they're canny and sure-footed throughout.

p6141

VUnconcerned, Cimino secured financial backing outside the usual channels by turning to Britain's EMI, and then took further decisions that, at least at the time, seemed crazy: making the film last a whopping three hours (with a Russian Orthodox wedding sequence near the film's beginning matching the length of all the war scenes in the middle), and placing alongside his established star Robert De Niro an ensemble of relative or total unknowns, as well as John Cazale, whose cancer meant there was a real risk that he would not live to complete his final part (in fact he died shortly after the production ended).

VThe Deer Hunter swept the board at film awards ceremonies, was a phenomenon at the box-office, and launched the cinematic careers of newcomers Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken.
p6147
tp6148
a(I0
VThe reasons behind its great success are easy enough to see: it boasts extraordinarily nuanced performances from what is, at least in retrospect, a dream cast; it is technically very accomplished, without once seeming flashy or ringing false; and it manages to root its grand epic themes in a compellingly intimate human drama.
p6149
tp6150
a(I0
VThe Deer Hunter is, in short, a deserved classic.The film also, in its day, courted considerable controversy, chiefly because of its portrayal of Vietcong soldiers forcing their prisoners (American and Vietnamese alike) to play Russian roulette.
p6151
tp6152
a(I0
V'Hanoi' Jane Fonda, whose own, similarly themed film Coming Home was in fierce competition with The Deer Hunter at the 1979 Academy Awards, accused Cimino of racism, historians denied that there was any evidence of Russian roulette being played in the conflict, while a confederacy of psychologists and media pundits blamed the film for a spate of Russian roulette-related deaths in the US following its release.
p6153
tp6154
a(I0
VThere is no doubt that Cimino's chosen focus is on his American characters, although whether this constitutes racism is more open to question - he certainly does not shy away from showing American brutality.
p6155
tp6156
a(I0
VCimino has subsequently defended his film's bhistorical accuracy by claiming that Russian roulette is used on POWS even to this day as a weapon of torture - but it does not follow from this that it was ever used in Vietnam, and the uncomfortable probability remains that the 'continuing', if thankfully marginalised, practice in today's conflicts is inspired less by the realities of the Indo-Chinese experience than by the accessible fictions of The Deer Hunter itself.
p6157
tp6158
a(I0
VWhat is certain is that the film's Russian roulette sequences constitute an arresting metaphor for the random cruelty of death in war and, thanks to the care which Cimino has taken in building up the viewer's investment in his tormented characters, these scenes are as involving, upsetting and unbearably tense as anything that has ever appeared in cinema.Viewed now, some decades after it was made, what seems most striking about The Deer Hunter is the sensitivity with which it charted the shifting mood of its times.
p6159
tp6160
a(I0
VAfter Vietnam, after Watergate, after nearly a decade of self-examination, anti-authoritarianism and cynicism, when all the old American verities had fallen away and patriotism had become a dirty word, Cimino seemed almost alone in discerning that, in a nation shaken to its very foundations by distrust, there still remained a growing desire to return to some of the old faiths, values and traditions.
p6161
tp6162
a(I0
VHis story of three young working-class men from the heartlands (De Niro, Walken, Savage), whose lives are all forever changed by their tour of duty in Vietnam, is a harrowing reflection of America's experience in the first half of the 1970s; but the film's final, ambivalent sequence, in which the two survivors gather at a wake for the third with a small group of friends and lovers and find solace in the words of 'God Bless America', instead looks forward to the future.
p6163
tp6164
a(I0
VCimino's characters, who are only semi-articulate at the best of times, never actually voice an opinion on America's Indo-Chinese ventures, and it is not clear whether Michael, Nick and Steve go to Vietnam because they are patriots, or conscripts, or because it is in their eyes, much like the mountains back home where they hunt for deer, just another all-male domain in which they can play out their games of cameraderie and machismo.
p6165
tp6166
a(I0
VIn this way, Cimino side-stepped the narrow ideological controversies of his times, making a film that could (and did) touch both fervent supporters and vehement opponents of the Vietnam War - and the same is true for his ending, which seems to reassert an America that rests on faith and patriotism, even as it calls into question whether such terms can any longer have the same meaning as they did before.
p6167
tp6168

VIt is a mixed message that looks back to all the doubts and disillusionments of the seventies, while at the same time paving the way for the new conservatism of the eighties under Reagan.
p6169
tp6170
a(I0
VOn top of all this, The Deer Hunter is at once a war epic (whose focus on the homecoming of De Niro's hero Michael Vronsky evokes both Homer's 'Odyssey' and Tolstoy's 'War and Peace'), a realistic portrait of a sleepy Russian Orthodox steeltown in Pennsylvania, and a story of male friendship that, post-Brokeback Mountain, seems full of unspoken desire and sublimated longings.

VBullock's tight-arsed New York FBI agent is essentially a loose variation on her Miss Congeniality character, Gracie Hart: a book-smart professional with no friends, no family, no boyfriend and both eyes on a potential promotion, Sarah Ashburn is not a team player.
p6328

a(I0
VSent to Boston to investigate some gangland murders, the arrogant Ashburn sparks an explosive clash of wills when she tries to steamroller her Irish working class partner Shannon Mullins, a loud-mouthed local gal with street smarts, a fridge full of weapons and an intimate knowledge of her jealously-guarded home turf.
p6330
tp6331

VPolice work initially takes a back seat as the two determined women go head-to-head: Ashburn likes getting inside the criminal's heads; Mullins would rather crack them open.
p6332

VFeig makes no secret of the fact that he prefers broad, physical humour to clever, wordy comedy, so there's nothing subtle about the violent slapstick action or rude jokes: Mullins' graphic description of Ashburn's neglected nether-regions is a case in point.
p6338
tp6339

VThis, the work of a single, solitary evening - presented as a lonely, intoxicating power trip - sets the stage perfectly for the film to come.The online politics of relationships, the need to not only belong but be at the top, the excitement of rage-fuelled creation and destruction, where exactly inspiration comes from and whether you can own it, the nature of friendship, the nature of competing truths, the impossibility of objectivity - these are huge ideas and The Social Network tackles them head on with a stylish wit.

VBasin City is, after all, a locus of the imagination, built on pure genre, a place familiar from every hard-boiled novel you have ever read or film noir you have ever seen - although it has been most directly inspired by a series of homonymous graphic novels by Frank Miller, who here serves as screenwriter and co-director (with Robert Rodriguez).
p7199

VIn this town, seemingly every man is corrupt or a killer, and every femme is fatale or a whore, and as several episodes are woven around both each other and the three that featured in the first film, you might well become as forgetful of the relative chronology as Marv (Mickey Rourke), the tank-like bruiser whom we first meet flying through the air and struggling to remember how he got in this predicament.

VHe was in the first film too - indeed, he met his end in it - as were several other characters, although not all have the same faces or are played by the same actors, and at least one (Bruce Willis' Hartigan) is now a mere ghost, haunting the troubled psyche of stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba).

p7205
tp7206
a(I0
VThe addition of 3D to the Brechtian spareness of the first film's backgrounds, to the mannered monochrome occasionally splashed with colour, to the cartoonishness of the violence, and to the archetypal nature of the scenarios and their players, highlights all the more the overt artifice of a world constructed from potboiler literature and B cinema.
