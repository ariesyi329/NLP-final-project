VNot really, but given the subject matter there's a delicious irony in the fact that such a good-looking, efficiently constructed and commercially-oriented film pulled a fast one over the critics and Academy voters.Set in Chicago in 1936, Redford stars as short-con operator Johnny Hooker who, together with long-term mentor Luther (Jones), unwittingly rips off $5000 from menacing Irish mobster Lonegan (Shaw).

VUsing a voiceover narration, much of which is taken verbatim from King's story, the film's great triumph is its sincerity, and even those moments that might have felt mawkish - the suicide of the old lag, for example, who fails to adjust to life on the outside - achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy.

VRichard Linklater, director of the peerless Before triptych (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight) has here hit upon a no-brainer conceit that all but renders its generic compatriots obsolete.
p388
tp389
a(I0
VBut the magic of Boyhood's high concept behind-the-scenes idea - to reform the cast and crew periodically over 12 years, thereby crafting a literal, \u2018before your very eyes\u2019 type of coming-of-age movie - lies in the many ways that Linklater harnesses the period and passing of time into his very unique project.
p390
tp391
a(I0
VBoyhood drops in on Mason (Ellar Coltrane) roughly once every few months over the course of a dozen years, seeing him grow from kid to teen to adult alongside his separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke), his sister (Linklater\u2019s daughter, Lorelei) and a supporting cast of friends and step-family.
p392
tp393
a(I0
VTo start, Coltrane is not a precocious child actor, cutting more of an unassuming, naturalistic figure in early scenes of sky-gazing and rock-collecting; but over the years Mason grows from shy kid into a bona fide Linklater youth, the sort the director nailed in Dazed & Confused and Slacker, always ready with a laconic stare and a rambling philosophical rant.
p394
tp395
a(I0
VAs with most real-life kids, though, Mason\u2019s world is framed, shaped and structured by his parents, but watching the years melt away puts the audience in a unique spot, so that when he finally, in his teens, starts to develop a life of his own - and he receives his own Linklater-trademark backwards tracking shot (think: almost every walking-and-talking scene in the Before trilogy) - we\u2019re the proud family members, amazed at how quickly he\u2019s grown up.
p396
tp397

VMason may be our anchor, but characters, themes and settings grow along with him, making this film just as much a Parenthood (Arquette\u2019s character\u2019s progression from  thirty-something single mum to successful middle-aged academic could easily be a film in its own right) or, if we\u2019re on a literal title kick, American Family, as the States\u2019 own social landscape shifts in the background of the drama, thrown into sharp relief by Linklater\u2019s episodic, observational style.
p400
tp401
a(I0
VFrom Halo to Wii Sports, from iMacs to iPhones, from Britney Spears to Lady Gaga, Boyhood is a survey of 21st-century mainstream pop culture touchstones that, due to the very nature of its production, falls somewhere between the historical and the contemporary.
p402
tp403
a(I0
VAnd as Linklater incorporates the War in Afghanistan, the groundswell of idealism that greeted Obama\u2019s first term in office, and eventually the recession, he reveals that while these events and trends may seem discrete on reflection, in reality they happen in quick succession, or sometimes all at once.
p404

VBasin City is, after all, a locus of the imagination, built on pure genre, a place familiar from every hard-boiled novel you have ever read or film noir you have ever seen - although it has been most directly inspired by a series of homonymous graphic novels by Frank Miller, who here serves as screenwriter and co-director (with Robert Rodriguez).
p666
tp667

VIn this town, seemingly every man is corrupt or a killer, and every femme is fatale or a whore, and as several episodes are woven around both each other and the three that featured in the first film, you might well become as forgetful of the relative chronology as Marv (Mickey Rourke), the tank-like bruiser whom we first meet flying through the air and struggling to remember how he got in this predicament.
p668
tp669
a(I0
VHe was in the first film too - indeed, he met his end in it - as were several other characters, although not all have the same faces or are played by the same actors, and at least one (Bruce Willis' Hartigan) is now a mere ghost, haunting the troubled psyche of stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba).
p670
tp671
a(I0
VThere are also some newly introduced characters: Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the gambler on a roll who is about to be taught by Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) that power trumps luck; and Ava Lord (Eva Green), the apotheosis of cruel seduction whose forward sexuality and frequent nudity the filmmakers are banking (no doubt correctly) will prove as irresistible a siren call to many viewers as to her former lover Dwight (here played by Josh Brolin, in a prequel to the story from the first film where he was played by Clive Owen).
p672
tp673
a(I0
VThe addition of 3D to the Brechtian spareness of the first film's backgrounds, to the mannered monochrome occasionally splashed with colour, to the cartoonishness of the violence, and to the archetypal nature of the scenarios and their players, highlights all the more the overt artifice of a world constructed from potboiler literature and B cinema.

a(I0
VIt's a considerable achievement that Joker can flip between appalling John Wayne impersonations and potentially toe-curling mediations such as "the dead know only one thing: it is better to be alive," while remaining a consistent, believable character.Despite assurances from those involved in its making that Full Metal Jacket was subject to Kubrick's typically extended shooting schedule and attention to detail, there's a willingness to move things along with none of the leisurely pacing that can make a viewing of 2001 or Barry Lyndon such a daunting prospect.

VWithout getting into the nitty gritty of how much both Baxter and Fran suffer, and the odiousness of their male colleagues, the bottom line with The Apartment is that no one (bar maybe Clifford Odets with Sweet Smell Of Success) wrote dialogue as smart, incisive and witty as Wilder and Diamond, and The Apartment is the prime period of their collaboration.

p1968

VAs Eisuke continues his compulsive onslaught through the cities of Japan, it emerges that Shino and Matsuko are themselves trapped in their own repeating cycles of complicity, guilt and despair, all going back to the catastrophic collapse, several years earlier, of a collective farm on which the four had worked together.

VIf Nagisa Oshima's Night And Fog In Japan (1960), with its jaundiced view of progress, showed the first ripples of the Japanese New Wave, then the similarly themed Violence At High Noon, made just six years later, was a veritable tsunami of innovations in cinematic expression.

p1974
tp1975
a(I0
VBut where Night And Fog was dominated by the sort of long sequence shots that typified the classical cinema of Mizoguchi or Ozu, the narrative of Violence At High Noon is slashed and fractured, whether through the compulsive restlessness of Keiichi Uraoka's editing or the delirious mobility of Akira Takada's Cinemascope camerawork.
p1976
tp1977
a(I0
VIt is as though Eisuke's neurotic tension has infected the whole world, in a film that is dissecting the pathology of a nation as much as of any individual.
p1978

VCruel, drunken Eisuke holds up a mirror to the aggression, rapacity, misogyny and inhumanity within a society still coming to terms with both its brutal wartime conduct and its rapid post-war transition to Western-style capitalism (with all of the political compromise that such a transition entails) - and it is a mirror in which Shino, Matsuko and Eisuke all see themselves uncomfortably reflected.

VShino, the youngest member of the original collective farm, is last seen literally biting through a rope that binds her to another character as though she were cutting an umbilical cord - but her earlier attempts to be 'reborn' and to sever her links to the past have all ended up bringing her right back to where she started, leading her at one point to declare, "I'll never be free".
p1984
tp1985
a(I0
VThe best that can be said for her prospects is that she is a natural survivor (several times over).Meanwhile the next generation, as embodied by Matsuko's young school pupils, may well turn out to be just like Eisuke (who after all was himself once a pupil of Matsuko's), and they are last glimpsed standing confused in the middle of an imposing modern city where a distraught Matsuko has suddenly abandoned them with the words, "I wish you all good luck."

p1990
