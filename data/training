p41

p55
tp56
a(I0
VWith her reliance on iron and gunpowder, Eboshi exemplifies human drive at the expense of the environment.

VThat he and his classmates are voiced by graduates of the Apatow school of slacker comedy (including Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Kristen Wiig) only adds to the nervy hilarity of it all, as though living with constant danger from above were no different from trying to be superbad in senior high or coping with getting a girlfriend knocked up.

VOlivier's chemistry with Joan Fontaine sets the screen alight - an impressive achievement if credence is given to the stories that he barely had the time of day for the actress, furious that Vivien Leigh (his first choice for the role and girlfriend at the time) didn't get the part.Naturally, Hitchcock is said to have used this situation to his advantage, teasing the young ingénue Fontaine (she was just 21) mercilessly, while encouraging the rest of the cast to treat her coldly.
p357
tp358
a(I0
VThe tactic led to a performance that strikes just the right tone of diffidence, nerviness and downright terror and goes a long way to proving that the young star was far more than just a pretty face.

VEn route there's jail, betrayal, opium and murder but through it all Noodles and Max remain bound by the dreams they shared as kids - dreams that sometimes sustain them, and other times threaten to destroy them.Any simple description of the plot fails to convey the complexity of the various relationships, or the fragmented nature of the story - a brilliantly structured mosaic of memories drawn together by the symbol of a ringing telephone, echoing down the years.

VWhere once Andy was a six-year-old boy, adoringly playing with his favourite toys, now he's a young man, poised to leave for college.
p451
tp452

VThe main thrust of the story here is the question of how the toys cope when the boy becomes the man, and puts away childish things.
p453

VAndy decides to take Woody with him to college and store the rest of the crew - Buzz, Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Mr Potato Head (Don Rickles), Mrs Potato Head (Estelle Harris), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and co - in the attic.

p469

VWoody doesn't give up on Andy so easily though, so he escapes, and is picked up by a little girl called Bonnie.
p471
tp472

p473

VBetween them, and Pixar's enormously talented crew of designers, animators, visual effects people etc, they've crafted a film that's funny, moving, sentimental and insightful, as it maps a human life, human relationships - specifically a boy leaving home, a mother's bond with that boy - through the medium of sentient plastic toys.

V\u000aGreeted as something of a curiosity at the time, 2009\u2019s stop-motion animation Fantastic Mr Fox signalled a new phase in the career of aesthete-cum-filmmaker Wes Anderson.
p500
tp501
a(I0
VMoonrise Kingdom (2012) picked up where Fantastic Mr Fox left off, transposing the warm, earthy tones and Davy Crockett hats into the live-action sphere, while marrying Anderson\u2019s esoteric obsessions (immaculate frame composition, retro soundtracks, period trappings) to a charming tale of young love.
p502
tp503
a(I0
VBut where The Grand Budapest Hotel most markedly differs from its predecessors - and, in fact, the bulk of Anderson\u2019s work to date - is that it looks beyond the director\u2019s distinctively aesthetic concerns and tackles larger themes.
p504
tp505
a(I0
VA nested story-within-a-story structure situates us in the past while stressing the expanse of time that exists between then and now: in a gloomy, modern-day Eastern Europe, a girl reads a cute little hardback titled The Grand Budapest Hotel, written by a long-dead author; in flashback, the author (Tom Wilkinson) recites his novel to the camera; in further flashback, the young author (Jude Law) visits the titular hotel and strikes up a conversation with its owner Zero Moustafa (F Murray Abraham), who, in one final flashback that lasts for the bulk of the film, spins a yarn of hijinks and intrigue during the interwar period in the (fictional) country of Zubrowka.
p506
tp507
a(I0
VAt the centre of the action is concierge-supreme Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes, in a deliciously fruity semi-comic turn), whose reign as chief of the Grand Budapest Hotel cemented its reputation as an alpine retreat par excellence.
p508
tp509
a(I0
VIn a breathless tracking shot that recalls Anderson\u2019s cheeky commercial for American Express, Gustave is seen ploughing through the hotel overseeing every element of its smooth running, right down to the guests\u2019 nail polish, exemplifying an aesthetic fastidiousness that even Anderson newcomers will recognise as an extension of the director\u2019s own auteurist attention to detail.
p510
tp511
a(I0
VBoth Anderson and Gustave\u2019s impressive faculties are pushed to the limit by the film\u2019s twisty plot, which is replete with high-speed chases, prison breakouts, secret societies, stolen paintings, assassins, fascists and dead dowagers.
p512
tp513
a(I0
VIt\u2019s the sort of derring-do that recalls the caper-filled adventures of Belgian boy-wonder Tintin, with Gustave and young Zero (Tony Revolori) high-tailing it from one sticky situation to another.
p514
tp515
a(I0
VAnderson\u2019s stylised approach (not to mention Adam Stockhausen\u2019s picture-postcard production design) perfectly matches his zest for storytelling, and he\u2019s able to keep the peppy pace going while providing a whistle-stop tour through a superb cast of cameos, including appearances from the likes of Tilda Swinton, Mathieu Amalric, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Willem Dafoe and Lea Seydoux.
p516
tp517
a(I0
VBut The Grand Budapest Hotel is more than just a character-filled chamber piece or a stylistic tour-de-force; the story of Zero, Gustave and their august institution is a paean to both an era and a social order that were completely eradicated by the 20th Century\u2019s hot and cold wars.
p518
tp519
a(I0
VThe \u2018enchanting old ruin\u2019, as the older Zero calls it, is as much a relic for a bygone age as it is a touchstone for certain qualities also lost - a decadence, perhaps, but also a strict, yet generous propriety best epitomised by Gustave himself.\u000a

a(I0
VFeaturing some of the most relentlessly grim production design in recent British cinema and a protagonist who suffers cruel violence from most people he encounters in the film, Nic Moran's adaptation of Kevin Lewis' best-selling autobiographical novels is a stark reminder of its true sense.
p1124
tp1125
a(I0
VFrom the moment we meet Kevin, dumped on a roadside following a savage beating, he's bruised and battered, and - whether through extended flashbacks to his brutally abusive childhood, or in his adult life as a bare-knuckle boxer forced to inhabit London's criminal underworld - rarely a scene goes by where he's not used as a punchbag.
p1126

VIf you sat down to watch The Kid, blissfully unaware it was modeled on fact rather than fiction, the queasily familiar story arc (mistreated, deprived but bright boy finds love and comes good), characters (inspiring young English teacher makes Shakespeare cool) and motifs (Kevin's only solace is classical music, listened to on Walkman given to him by inspiring young English teacher) would probably make you scoff.
p1130
tp1131

VNor does it help that the abominably miscast Natascha McElhone, as Kevin's unhinged mother and chief abuser - fully 'uglied' up, in false teeth, NHS glasses, housecoat, with fag drooping from perma-snarl and a bawling baby surgically attached to her person - is played as a one-dimensional pantomime villain with shades of Janet Street Porter.

VSo we are told in one scene of The Help, actor-turned-director Tate Taylor's blandly enjoyable adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's Civil Rights-themed bestseller, and there's little reason to doubt this endorsement: the entire film appears to have been made of the stuff.
p2194
tp2195
a(I0
VAs lily-white a tale of the black experience as could imaginably be put to screen in the 21st century, Taylor's polished period piece raises something of an if-a-tree-falls-in-the-forest question: if the story of the publication of a landmark book, one that changed attitudes to race relations in an especially bigoted corner of the Deep South, never really happened, what does it ultimately signify?
p2196
tp2197
a(I0
VIf the film inevitably inherits the unearned self-importance of Stockett's novel, however, it remains a hearty and stirring fiction, its over-ironed social and moral landscape lent feeling and texture by a busily stranded narrative and some empathetic performances that elegantly separate the human truths from the screenplay's homilies.
p2198
tp2199
a(I0
VChief among these is Viola Davis, deservedly a dead cert for Oscar recognition in 2012: as written, the relentlessly stoic, noble Aibileen should be a scarcely penetrable stereotype, yet she becomes bruised flesh and blood through Davis's rich line readings and creased body language.
p2200
tp2201
a(I0
VThe rest of the ensemble is a mixed bag, ranging from the wonderful Jessica Chastain, as a guilelessly liberal trophy wife, to the overly panto-ready Bryce Dallas Howard, as the queen bee of the oppressors - with a disappointingly de-amped Emma Stone, as our mostly symbolic protagonist, somewhere in between.
p2202

VIt was arguably only with Asif Kapadia's 2010 documentary masterpiece Senna that moviegoers' eyes were really opened to the intense human drama so often on display throughout the history of Formula One \u2013 and to the fact that there might actually be something significant and universal lurking underneath the fast-paced, glamorous surface.
p2222

p2226
tp2227
a(I0
VThe Hunt and Lauda feud that ran throughout the 1976 season is a goldmine for Morgan, presenting him as it does with two almost diametrically opposed personalities \u2013 and yet, with each as fascinating as the other, and both equally able to inspire empathy alongside disapproval, the script never resorts to painting one as the hero or villain.

p2230
tp2231

VThere's possibly a slight bias shown towards Lauda, mind, whose cold and undiplomatic exterior is gradually peeled back thanks in part to his remarkable recovery from his accident, and to a romantic subplot that feels warmer than Hunt's ill-fated marriage to model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde).
p2232
tp2233
a(I0
VIt also helps the Austrian's case that Daniel Brühl's performance is as remarkable it is \u2013 he inhabits Lauda, who remains a high-profile presence on the F1 circuit, in an uncanny fashion, making him a more compelling figure than may seem at first glance.
