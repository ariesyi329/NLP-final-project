p193
tp194

VHis second feature for the groundbreaking Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki hoped the film would build upon the success of his earlier offerings, the pre-Ghibli Nausicaa And The Valley Of The Wind and the Studio's debut production Laputa: Castle In The Sky.As it turned out, My Neighbour Totoro did not set the Japanese box office alight, but just as audiences eventually came around to Citizen Kane and It's A Wonderful Life, over time the public learned to love this movie.
p195
tp196

VIndeed, it is now considered one of Miyazaki's greatest works, and is hailed as one of the key films that introduced Japanese animation to the English-speaking world.
p197
tp198
a(I0
VMy Neighbour Totoro is the story of two little girls, Satsuki and Mei (Noriko Hidaka and Chika Sakamoto respectively, or, in the English dub, real-life sisters Dakota and Elle Fanning), who travel to the country with their father.

p203
tp204

VThe girls' adventures with their new friends are by turns enchanting and whimsical, displaying Miyazaki's unrivalled skill at transporting children's unfettered imagination, keen curiosity and sense of wonder onto the big screen.
p205
tp206
a(I0
VUnder Miyazaki's direction, even the everyday is transformed into something fantastical, and simple chores like cleaning a dusty house and waiting for the bus in the rain are made into unforgettable moments of pure magic.

VHowever, My Neighbour Totoro steps back from the precipice of tweeness by rooting the film in small-scale, humanistic themes of coming of age and potential loss.

VThey all baulked, unconvinced that the American cinema-going public was ready to see the recent wounds of Vietnam reopened.
p224
tp225
a(I0
VUnconcerned, Cimino secured financial backing outside the usual channels by turning to Britain's EMI, and then took further decisions that, at least at the time, seemed crazy: making the film last a whopping three hours (with a Russian Orthodox wedding sequence near the film's beginning matching the length of all the war scenes in the middle), and placing alongside his established star Robert De Niro an ensemble of relative or total unknowns, as well as John Cazale, whose cancer meant there was a real risk that he would not live to complete his final part (in fact he died shortly after the production ended).
p226

VThe rest is history.
p228

a(I0
VThe Deer Hunter swept the board at film awards ceremonies, was a phenomenon at the box-office, and launched the cinematic careers of newcomers Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken.
p230
tp231
a(I0
VThe reasons behind its great success are easy enough to see: it boasts extraordinarily nuanced performances from what is, at least in retrospect, a dream cast; it is technically very accomplished, without once seeming flashy or ringing false; and it manages to root its grand epic themes in a compellingly intimate human drama.
p232
tp233
a(I0
VThe Deer Hunter is, in short, a deserved classic.The film also, in its day, courted considerable controversy, chiefly because of its portrayal of Vietcong soldiers forcing their prisoners (American and Vietnamese alike) to play Russian roulette.
p234
tp235
a(I0
V'Hanoi' Jane Fonda, whose own, similarly themed film Coming Home was in fierce competition with The Deer Hunter at the 1979 Academy Awards, accused Cimino of racism, historians denied that there was any evidence of Russian roulette being played in the conflict, while a confederacy of psychologists and media pundits blamed the film for a spate of Russian roulette-related deaths in the US following its release.
p236
tp237
a(I0
VThere is no doubt that Cimino's chosen focus is on his American characters, although whether this constitutes racism is more open to question - he certainly does not shy away from showing American brutality.
p238
tp239
a(I0
VCimino has subsequently defended his film's bhistorical accuracy by claiming that Russian roulette is used on POWS even to this day as a weapon of torture - but it does not follow from this that it was ever used in Vietnam, and the uncomfortable probability remains that the 'continuing', if thankfully marginalised, practice in today's conflicts is inspired less by the realities of the Indo-Chinese experience than by the accessible fictions of The Deer Hunter itself.
p240
tp241
a(I0
VWhat is certain is that the film's Russian roulette sequences constitute an arresting metaphor for the random cruelty of death in war and, thanks to the care which Cimino has taken in building up the viewer's investment in his tormented characters, these scenes are as involving, upsetting and unbearably tense as anything that has ever appeared in cinema.Viewed now, some decades after it was made, what seems most striking about The Deer Hunter is the sensitivity with which it charted the shifting mood of its times.
p242
tp243
a(I0
VAfter Vietnam, after Watergate, after nearly a decade of self-examination, anti-authoritarianism and cynicism, when all the old American verities had fallen away and patriotism had become a dirty word, Cimino seemed almost alone in discerning that, in a nation shaken to its very foundations by distrust, there still remained a growing desire to return to some of the old faiths, values and traditions.
p244
tp245
a(I0
VHis story of three young working-class men from the heartlands (De Niro, Walken, Savage), whose lives are all forever changed by their tour of duty in Vietnam, is a harrowing reflection of America's experience in the first half of the 1970s; but the film's final, ambivalent sequence, in which the two survivors gather at a wake for the third with a small group of friends and lovers and find solace in the words of 'God Bless America', instead looks forward to the future.
p246
tp247
a(I0
VCimino's characters, who are only semi-articulate at the best of times, never actually voice an opinion on America's Indo-Chinese ventures, and it is not clear whether Michael, Nick and Steve go to Vietnam because they are patriots, or conscripts, or because it is in their eyes, much like the mountains back home where they hunt for deer, just another all-male domain in which they can play out their games of cameraderie and machismo.
p248
tp249
a(I0
VIn this way, Cimino side-stepped the narrow ideological controversies of his times, making a film that could (and did) touch both fervent supporters and vehement opponents of the Vietnam War - and the same is true for his ending, which seems to reassert an America that rests on faith and patriotism, even as it calls into question whether such terms can any longer have the same meaning as they did before.
p250
tp251
a(I0
VIt is a mixed message that looks back to all the doubts and disillusionments of the seventies, while at the same time paving the way for the new conservatism of the eighties under Reagan.
p252
tp253
a(I0
VOn top of all this, The Deer Hunter is at once a war epic (whose focus on the homecoming of De Niro's hero Michael Vronsky evokes both Homer's 'Odyssey' and Tolstoy's 'War and Peace'), a realistic portrait of a sleepy Russian Orthodox steeltown in Pennsylvania, and a story of male friendship that, post-Brokeback Mountain, seems full of unspoken desire and sublimated longings.

a(I0
VThe film is memorable for its extended, virtuoso tracking shots through the trenches (they anticipate the crazed Steadicam of The Shining) and for the unprecedented realism of its battle scenes, with Kubrick using 800 German policemen for his troops (the film was shot in southern Germany) and with his art department having to go before the German government to explain why they needed so much explosive.

VIf we hadn't seen Spider-Man onscreen for decades, then perhaps the refresher would be necessary - but it's hard to shake the feeling that the major beats (outsider nerd, loving adoptive family, mutated spider bite, avoidable ironic tragedy) are iconic enough that they could have been dispensed with in an opening montage.

V\u000aMichel Gondry's first collaboration with contemporary Hollywood's most original screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, was 2001's Human Nature, a film that never received a theatrical release in the UK and sat in unfavourable comparison with the films the writer made with Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation).
p1065

V\u000aIn the imagination of filmmakers, there is something about the horrors of the Spanish Civil War and its immediate aftermath that lends itself to the innocent, often fanciful perspective of a child.
p1225
tp1226
a(I0
VSo Victor Erice's The Spirit Of The Beehive (1973) presented an idyllic Spanish postwar countryside through the eyes of a girl obsessed with James Whale's Frankenstein, and Guillermo Del Toro's The Devil's Backbone (2001) seamlessly merged the inexorable advance of fascism with a ghost story unfolding in a rural school for boys.
p1227
tp1228
a(I0
VPan's Labyrinth is a sister film to The Devil's Backbone, and similarly blends historical realism with more genre-bound fantasy elements to create an expansive, visionary and moving examination of Spain's darkest chapter of the last century.

p1233
tp1234
a(I0
VVidal's head housekeeper (Maribel Verdú) and doctor (Álex Angulo) are both secretly helping the resistance as best they can, and Ofélia too defies Vidal's monolithic worldview by retreating into her own fairytale imagination.
p1235
tp1236
a(I0
VAfter following a locust-like fairy into an ancient labyrinth bordering the estate, Ofélia meets the forest spirit Pan (Doug Jones), who sets her three tasks involving a giant greedy toad, the terrifying Pale Man (who devours children and holds his eyes in the palms of his hands), and the shedding of innocent blood.

p1243
tp1244
a(I0
VCarmen has, after all, allowed herself to become inextricably compromised, marrying her own and her children's fates to the rise of fascism.
p1245
tp1246
a(I0
VYet in Pan's Labyrinth, the world of Ofélia's imagination and the realities of Falangist Spain run in curious parallel as two different, ideologically opposed ways of telling the same story - a story of tyranny, resistance and the timeless struggle between good and evil.Ofélia's trials may be fanciful, but the woodland strife, mythical beasts, heroic acts, purloined keys, forbidden feasts and troubled births that constitute their essential furniture all reflect, through a glass darkly, the actual conflicts taking place around her, while the deadly reality of the dangers faced by the girl and others is never in any doubt.

VThe result is a Franco-era Brazil, where events outside and inside the mind gradually become indistinguishable as each allegorises and informs the other, so that the ending can be regarded as both horrifically tragic and redemptively triumphant at the same time - all depending on the limits of the viewer's own imagination.

a(I0
VFrom Cronos to Mimic to Blade II to Hellboy, Del Toro has always been associated with horror, but even if Pan's Labyrinth has its fair share of grotesquerie, brutality and visceral shocks, it is a film unbounded by genre, all at once children's fantasy, adult parable, historical drama and more, located at a magical crossroads where Labyrinth meets The Shining and Land And Freedom meets Ichi The Killer.
