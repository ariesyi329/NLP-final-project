VAlthough the soundtrack (including covers of Goldfinger and Mrs Robinson) is excellent, and it is Scorsese\u2019s funniest film by some distance, Wolf is neither musical nor comedy, more a riotously dayglo Goodfellas.

tp5
a(I0
VBeginning in a whir of crashing helicopters and tossed dwarves, it\u2019s a filthy, fizzy ride following the spectacular rise and predictable fall of 1980s stock market fraudster Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio).
p6
tp7
a(I0
VBut between the cameos (Matthew McConaughey, Joanna Lumley, Spike Jonze), globetrotting (London, Las Vegas, Auckland) and endless debauchery, there\u2019s a scabrous joie de vivre that\u2019s impossible to resist.
p8

a(I0
VOne scene sees Belfort vividly miming anal sex while closing a sale with a clueless client.
p10

p14
tp15
a(I1
VThough brilliantly written (by Boardwalk Empire\u2018s Terence Winter), acted and directed, Wolf is dangerously overlong.
p16
tp17

p18
tp19
a(I0
VCouldn\u2019t he have whizzed us through the details of his downfall the same way?
p20
tp21
a(I0

p45

VWhen the story finally gets going, we learn that billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has a plan to combat global warming and it\u2019s not exactly people-friendly.

p55

VMany luminaries go along with Valentine\u2019s plan, agreeing to the implants.
p57
tp58
a(I0
VOne of those leaders is apparently President Obama (America\u2019s favorite racial target).
p59
tp60
a(I0

p71
tp72
a(I0
VWhat kind of political message were they sending movie audiences?
p73
tp74
a(I0
VThe scenes in question admittedly happen very fast.
p75
tp76
a(I0
VPerhaps they were looking for a subliminal effect.
p77
tp78
a(I0
VStrike three.
p79

p100

VDaley and his son, Nicky (Styler Gisondo replacing Jake Cherry), sneak into the British Museum after delivering a large crate carrying the American exhibits.

tp129
a(I0
VBoth are greatly missed by Hollywood and the circumstances of Williams\u2019 death, in particular, make his presence more meaningful.
p130
tp131
a(I0
VPerhaps the story is contrived and the producers were out to make a few bucks.
p132
tp133

p134

p136

p140
tp141

p142
tp143
a(I0
VI particularly liked Stiller playing off himself as Daley meets Laaa, a Neanderthal who could be his doppelgänger.
p144
tp145
a(I0
VSome might think that the routine goes a bit too long.
p146
tp147
a(I0

p148

a(I0
VIf you\u2019re okay with the potty humor from the first two films, then you certainly won\u2019t mind the third.
p150

VJurassic Park\u2019s once-innovative technology may have been eclipsed by more sophisticated onscreen trickery in the two decades since its release, but the film still has plenty to offer audiences as a suspenseful adventure that has stood the test of time.

p175
tp176

p177
tp178
a(I0
VThe 3D conversion seems to have been approached with the film\u2019s mid-90s aesthetic firmly in mind.
p179
tp180
a(I0
VRather than trying to drag Jurassic Park kicking and screaming into the 21st Century there\u2019s a frequent Viewmaster-like feel to the layers that have been created, some elements pulled hard into the foreground while others are banished further into the background to create an environment of great depth.
p181
tp182
a(I0
VIt\u2019s a stylistic approach rather than a realistic one, further playing up the comic book feel established by the film\u2019s early colour palette and scale of its creatures and sets.
p183
tp184
a(I0
VOnce the adventure really begins, the 3D further enhances the amusement park ride feeling the film induces, proving a welcome addition that\u2019s more than the usual thinly-veiled excuse to wring a few more box office dollars out of punters.

p252

VComing across as perhaps the least shackled by the requirements of a typical origin story of any Marvel film to date, Guardians of the Galaxy quickly dispenses with its dramatic back story right up front, before picking up years later with Peter Quill (the wisecracking Chris Pratt) embarking on a futuristic Indiana Jones-like heist prologue that sets the visually spectacular, quip-heavy tone.

p1121
tp1122
a(I1
VIts combo of hair-raising behind-the-wheel action, heated off-track controversies and stormy relationship soap is hardly earth-shattering stuff, but Howard and writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) do squeeze sufficient dramatic tension out of the opponents\u2019 wildly different temperaments, while acknowledging their shared sense of purpose and conviction.
p1123
tp1124
a(I0
VHunt is the blonde-and-blue-eyed Brit, a hard-partying, hot-headed playboy with raw driving talent to spare; Lauda, on the other hand, is a brusquely pragmatic Austrian who doesn\u2019t have time for social frivolities, single-mindedly focused on the race to a fault.

VHemsworth and Brühl are both terrific, portraying the escalating competitive ribbing between the pair with good humour and genuine passion.

VTechnically, Howard doesn\u2019t do anything that John Frankenheimer didn\u2019t already achieve with Grand Prix back in 1966, but some of it sure is dang pretty: armed with Dogme veteran/regular Danny Boyle cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, Rush\u2019s racing sequences are gussied up with expressionistic splashes of hot, saturated colour that heighten the nerve-rattling, feverishly adrenalised view from inside the cockpit.

p1134
tp1135
a(I0
VBut where Moonrise was awash with wistful nostalgia in its take on adolescence, romance and scouting, Anderson\u2019s latest mines its period setting in service of a broadly comical tale which enjoys frequent diversions into both black and off-colour humour even as a body count amasses and the Second World War threatens to intrude on the borders of the titular hotel\u2019s fictitious homeland.
p1136
tp1137
a(I0
VThe cast list deceptively points to another sprawling ensemble effort, but despite the bountiful number of familiar faces on display and the amount of wandering in time and aspect ratio the film does, its arguably the most fixed around an individual performance of any Anderson pic since Rushmore.

p1512

p1537

p1539
tp1540
a(I0
VGiving himself more of that precious resource, time, to play with (and jettisoning the expected training montage second act), Nolan gets to introduce A-list actors late, indulge in sub-plots that don\u2019t emerge until the final half hour, and take us to some truly spectacular places along the way.

VGotham, explains Nolan, "is a parallel world, and you wind up mirroring the concerns of the time."
p2249
tp2250
a(I0
VOne concern among those who care about cinema is that it\u2019s being overrun by comic-book franchises: the masked superhero has usurped the face of the movie star as Hollywood\u2019s most powerful icon.
p2251

VWhich Nolan doesn\u2019t dispute.
p2253
tp2254

p2265
tp2266
a(I0

p2267

VBut Nolan, still a force behind Hollywood\u2019s superhero hegemony, is producing next year\u2019s Superman reboot, Man of Steel.
p2269
tp2270
a(I0
VThe key to comic-book material, he insists, is to treat it as "a source for movies of different types, not a genre\u2014if the comic-book movie is a genre, like the western, the audience will want something different."
p2271
tp2272
a(I0
VAs for his own directing future, "I have no idea where I\u2019m going next," says Nolan.
p2273
tp2274

VIncidentally, the filmmakers have also upped the ante of high-school sexuality, adding a dash of teenage sex (as normal dating activity) and a pregnancy.
