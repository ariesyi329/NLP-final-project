V \u000a\u000a\u000aEyebrows were raised when Martin Scorsese\u2019s real-life drama was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Musical Or Comedy.
p1
aVAlthough the soundtrack (including covers of Goldfinger and Mrs Robinson) is excellent, and it is Scorsese\u2019s funniest film by some distance, Wolf is neither musical nor comedy, more a riotously dayglo Goodfellas.
p2
aVBeginning in a whir of crashing helicopters and tossed dwarves, it\u2019s a filthy, fizzy ride following the spectacular rise and predictable fall of 1980s stock market fraudster Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio).
p3
aVBut between the cameos (Matthew McConaughey, Joanna Lumley, Spike Jonze), globetrotting (London, Las Vegas, Auckland) and endless debauchery, there\u2019s a scabrous joie de vivre that\u2019s impossible to resist.
p4
aVOne scene sees Belfort vividly miming anal sex while closing a sale with a clueless client.
p5
aVAnother has him and his colleagues enjoying themselves on a coke-and-hooker-filled private jet.
p6
aVMultiply that by 180 minutes and you have some idea what you\u2019re getting into.
p7
aVThough brilliantly written (by Boardwalk Empire\u2018s Terence Winter), acted and directed, Wolf is dangerously overlong.
p8
aVThis is especially galling because Belfort often speaks directly to the audience to speed the action on.
p9
aVCouldn\u2019t he have whizzed us through the details of his downfall the same way?
p10
aVThe only excuse is that the material is just too juicy to cut, and everyone, from a career-best DiCaprio, to his crack-smoking sidekick Jonah Hill, to Scorsese himself is having too good a time to stop.
p11
aVFor at least two of the three hours, you will be too.
p12
aVMaybe those Golden Globe guys were on to something after all.
p13
aV I couldn\u2019t get that thought out of my mind while watching this visually taxing and noisy spy spoof.
p14
aVCertainly, there is plenty going on in this send up of the British spy genre, not all of it good.
p15
aVColin Firth stars as secret agent Harry Hart, one of a select group of highly trained operatives, known collectively as Kingsman.
p16
aVThe bureau recruits British youth to join them, when there\u2019s a rare opening caused by an agent dying in the line of duty.
p17
aVEggsy (Taron Egerton) a twenty-something who dresses like rap star Eminem, is asked by Harry to try his luck at the rigorous training program.
p18
aVMuch of the film concerns the indoctrination procedures, and I found that to be strike one.
p19
aVThe dull preliminaries seemed to last for almost the film\u2019s length.
p20
aVToo much training and not enough story.
p21
aVGet on with it.
p22
aVWhen the story finally gets going, we learn that billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has a plan to combat global warming and it\u2019s not exactly people-friendly.
p23
aVWhy is the master villain someone who recognizes climate change as a problem that needs to be addressed?
p24
aVWere the producers pushing some redneck buttons by making the bad guy a believer in earth sciences?
p25
aVStrike two.
p26
aVBefore launching his plan, Valentine seeks to control the world\u2019s political leaders by inserting an explosive charge into each of their necks, meaning, step out of line, and your head will burst.
p27
aVMany luminaries go along with Valentine\u2019s plan, agreeing to the implants.
p28
aVOne of those leaders is apparently President Obama (America\u2019s favorite racial target).
p29
aVIt\u2019s possible that the actors didn\u2019t know about the director\u2019s plans to kill the Obama lookalike and his cabinet.
p30
aVThese scenes were filmed separately.
p31
aVI can\u2019t see Sam Jackson going along with this, but perhaps he did.
p32
aVThe film wasn\u2019t funny in the first place.
p33
aVNow, it was downright Rupert Murdochian.
p34
aVThe very conservative Murdoch owns Fox News and 20th Century Fox, the company that released the film.
p35
aVWhat kind of political message were they sending movie audiences?
p36
aVThe scenes in question admittedly happen very fast.
p37
aVPerhaps they were looking for a subliminal effect.
p38
aVStrike three.
p39
aVNow, I wasn\u2019t having a very good time to start with, so perhaps the political messages stood out more with me than your average moviegover.
p40
aVI found "Kingsman: The Secret Service" to be derivative, loud and overly broad.
p41
aVJackson\u2019s lisping billionaire was fun for a while, but then started to get on my nerves.
p42
aVFirth was downright dull.
p43
aVAnd, Egerton displayed nothing to recommend a future career in acting.
p44
aVSpy spoofs should be fun.
p45
aVWhat happened? 
p46
aV Ben Stiller and company create more than a few warm and fuzzies.
p47
aVThis time the fantasy premise jumps the pond to the British Museum in London.
p48
aVThe ancient Egyptian widget that keeps the exhibits alive in America is corroding, and museum guard Larry Daley (Stiller) must find out why.
p49
aVThe young pharaoh, Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek) tells Daley, he should consult with his father, Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley) at the London institution on what to do.
p50
aVMany of Daley\u2019s exhibits at the American Museum of Natural History secretly hitch a ride overseas.
p51
aVMaking the trip: Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Jedediah (Owen Wilson), Octavius (Steve Coogan), Sacagawea (Mizuo Peck) and Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher).
p52
aVOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be a family reunion without Ahkmenrah tagging along.
p53
aVDaley and his son, Nicky (Styler Gisondo replacing Jake Cherry), sneak into the British Museum after delivering a large crate carrying the American exhibits.
p54
aVAnd, of course, the entire institution springs to life thanks to the ancient widget, despite its oxidation.
p55
aVThey even get to meet Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens), who amusingly doesn\u2019t understand that he never existed.
p56
aVCamelot, he is told, was just a legend.
p57
aVLance is handsome, but not too smart.
p58
aVIt doesn\u2019t register right away.
p59
aVThis character can be taxing, but ultimately he\u2019s quite entertaining.
p60
aVAs I said before, "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb" won\u2019t draw raves for originality.
p61
aVIt\u2019s familiarity and sentimentality that rule the day.
p62
aVThis was the final film for Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams.
p63
aVBoth are greatly missed by Hollywood and the circumstances of Williams\u2019 death, in particular, make his presence more meaningful.
p64
aVPerhaps the story is contrived and the producers were out to make a few bucks.
p65
aV"Night at the Museum 3\u2033 is a feel-good movie, and that counts for something.
p66
aVTech credits are fine.
p67
aVThe special effects seem a bit old-fashioned, but they work.
p68
aVThe acting is about what you\u2019d expect in a big-budget all-star vehicle.
p69
aVEveryone has their moment.
p70
aVI particularly liked Stiller playing off himself as Daley meets Laaa, a Neanderthal who could be his doppelgänger.
p71
aVSome might think that the routine goes a bit too long.
p72
aVI found the repetition is what made it funny.
p73
aVIf you\u2019re okay with the potty humor from the first two films, then you certainly won\u2019t mind the third.
p74
aVI think maybe the monkey urinating might be the most bawdy moment.
p75
aVAnd, you know kids.
p76
aVThey love that kind of stuff.
p77
aV"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb" was a pleasant surprise.
p78
aVNothing spectacular.
p79
aVBut, a fun ride for the family. 
p80
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aSteven Spielberg\u2019s sci-fi, monster-movie classic re-released in 3D.
p81
aVRead more and find movie times.
p82
aVJurassic Park\u2019s once-innovative technology may have been eclipsed by more sophisticated onscreen trickery in the two decades since its release, but the film still has plenty to offer audiences as a suspenseful adventure that has stood the test of time.
p83
aVThat\u2019s not to say the last twenty years have been particularly kind to its costumes or onscreen gadgets ("look, a CD-ROM!
p84
aV!
p85
aV"), or the chaos theory pop science spouted throughout by Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum in a performance that now is plain weird \u2013 or plain awesome).
p86
aVThese aspects of the film prove vaguely snigger-inducing throughout its first act, but in a testament to Spielberg\u2019s powers \u2013 utilised here in arguably his last great adventure yarn \u2013 once the dino-doo hits the fan and giant carnivores start running amok, Jurassic Park still proves as thrilling as ever.
p87
aVThe 3D conversion seems to have been approached with the film\u2019s mid-90s aesthetic firmly in mind.
p88
aVRather than trying to drag Jurassic Park kicking and screaming into the 21st Century there\u2019s a frequent Viewmaster-like feel to the layers that have been created, some elements pulled hard into the foreground while others are banished further into the background to create an environment of great depth.
p89
aVIt\u2019s a stylistic approach rather than a realistic one, further playing up the comic book feel established by the film\u2019s early colour palette and scale of its creatures and sets.
p90
aVOnce the adventure really begins, the 3D further enhances the amusement park ride feeling the film induces, proving a welcome addition that\u2019s more than the usual thinly-veiled excuse to wring a few more box office dollars out of punters.
p91
aV Some say Hollywood is converting too many old films to 3D.
p92
aVBut, "Jurassic Park" was the perfect choice.
p93
aVThere\u2019s nothing more fun than sharing a seat with a snapping dinosaur.
p94
aVI can\u2019t imagine anyone not having seen this 1993 sci-fi thriller by Steven Spielberg.
p95
aVEven if you dislike this type of movie, you probably surfed by it a few times on television and maybe watched a scene or two.
p96
aVI happen to love this type of movie and can even remember where I was when I saw it for the first time.
p97
aVIt\u2019s an event movie.
p98
aVThe 3D effects are excellent.
p99
aVThere\u2019s plenty of enhanced depth perception.
p100
aVAnd, the raptor and T-Rex sequences are stunning in 3D.
p101
aVThere\u2019s one scene in particular where a raptor tries to snap at Laura Dern\u2019s butt, after she climbs into a ventilation system at the theme park\u2019s visitors center.
p102
aV"Jurassic Park" was first released on June 11, 1993.
p103
aVAnd, it has held up over the years, a true classic.
p104
aVIt ranks as the 20th highest-grossing film in North America.
p105
aVIt\u2019s about $85 million short of hitting the one-billion dollar mark.
p106
aVI doubt if this latest theatrical release will bring that much money.
p107
aVBut, there will be plenty of folks willing to visit "Jurassic Park" just one more time for some really cool 3D enhanced effects.  
p108
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aWinning kids over with its cartoonishness, adults with its wittiness, and stoned college students with its absurdness, Sponge Out of Water is an animated Monty Python movie you can take the whole family to.
p109
aVWith absolutely no interest in teaching morals or life lessons with a straight face, the film stays true to the essence of the Spongebob phenomenon: delivering pure laughs in every surreal, bonkers way it can.
p110
aVA brief description of the plot will give you a taste of the lunacy on offer: Bikini Bottom literally jump-cuts into chaos when the Krabby Patty formula goes missing.
p111
aVThe town\u2019s only hope is Spongebob, Plankton, and a time machine made from a photo-booth and day-old nachos.
p112
aVThat\u2019s the tip of this insanity iceberg, one that is filled with an impressive variety of jokes that span from delightfully childish visual gags to oddball one-liners ("Welcome to the apocalypse; I hope you like leather").
p113
aVThere\u2019s even a sugar-coated reference to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining.
p114
aVThe animators have done a flawless job with the "out of water" leap from 2D to 3D, though it only makes up 15 minutes of the film.
p115
aVHowever, keeping human interaction to a minimum prevents it from feeling too distant from the \u2018bob world we love (an effect I call \u2018Smurfing it up\u2019).
p116
aVThe only jokes that flop with a thud are the ones that recycle material used in the series.
p117
aVThe biggest offender is a tame musical number where Spongebob teaches Plankton about teamwork, which is nowhere near as F.U.N.
p118
aVas the original song.
p119
aVBut this is merely one of a few dud bullets coming from a movie that duel-wields machine guns loaded with gags.
p120
aV Generally speaking, I don\u2019t like them.
p121
aVThe 2011 version of "The Thing" is a bit of an exception.
p122
aVNothing will ever replace the awe and horror of 1982\u2019s "The Thing" by John Carpenter.
p123
aVThe special effects were state-of-the-art in the early 1980\u2019s, making a huge impression on me at the time.
p124
aVThe 2011 prequel has much more impressive effects, but the story had only one place to go, and that\u2019s to the beginning of 1982 story.
p125
aVIn other words, diehard Carpenter fans know how this all must end.
p126
aVBut, true horror afficionados can enjoy a good blood-letting all the same.
p127
aVThis new version has decent creature effects and moderately sympathetic characters.
p128
aVAnyway, a team of Norwegian and American scientists discover an alien spacecraft deep in the ice of Antarctica.
p129
aVThey also discover the remains of an alien near the ship.
p130
aVIt\u2019s the biological aspect of this dig that fascinates them.
p131
aVAmong the Americans is Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who warns against working too fast to examine the frozen remains.
p132
aVOf course, she\u2019s ignored and all hell breaks loose.
p133
aVHey, she had to be ignored or this would have been nothing more than a boring science project.
p134
aVInstead, the creature comes alive and is really pissed off.
p135
aVOh, yes.
p136
aVThere will be blood.
p137
aVThe creature attacks by absorbing its victims and then replicates them into something that\u2019s not quite human.
p138
aVLike the Carpenter film, the question becomes "who is human and who wants to make breakfast out of your brain?"
p139
aV"The Thing" is not half as good as the Carpenter film, but it has enough shocks and scares to keep you interested.
p140
aVAnd, if you see it first, then at least you have the back story for viewing the 1982 classic.
p141
aVGore is good.  
p142
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aAs a stress-inducing exercise in cinematic asphyxiation, Whiplash is this year\u2019s Gravity.
p143
aVWhere Alfonso Cuarón\u2019s film placed an astronaut into merciless space, writer-director Damien Chazelle chucks 19-year-old jazz drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) into the merciless grasp of a brutal music instructor (JK Simmons).
p144
aVAnd just like Gravity, Whiplash is bound for Oscars.
p145
aVTeller\u2019s performance transcends his previous roles, infusing Andrew with natural innocence slowly warped by a necessary arrogance as he seeks to "be the best".
p146
aVThis passion drives him, but also traps him in the torturous tutelage of Fletcher, played by the brilliantly frightening Simmons.
p147
aVAndrew wants to please Fletcher, but Fletcher keeps the bar drastically out of reach by implementing physical and psychological cruelty that is not only sickening, it\u2019s calculated \u2013 a method he\u2019s refined to an abusive art-form.
p148
aVThe tension comes from how far Andrew is willing to stretch himself to get to that impossible bar, and whether or not he\u2019ll snap in the process.
p149
aVAdding elements of claustrophobia to Fletcher\u2019s fearful classroom, Chazelle confines his shots to confronting close-ups and superb macro-photography of sweat-covered cymbals and Andrew\u2019s bleeding hands.
p150
aVOutside of practice, the filmmaking simplifies, creating a contrasting sense of ease.
p151
aVA rigid subset of audiences may not accept the plausibility of the scenarios (again, like Gravity), but those who submit to the film will be treated to a masterful finale that stills the lungs and silences the mind.
p152
aVAt its last beat of the drum, Whiplash allows you to exhale, only to force you into another quandary: do you applaud in admiration or quiver in horror?
p153
aV "A Most Violent Year" crackles with good acting, but fizzles from its slow pacing.
p154
aVMost of all, it reminds you of better films from the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s.
p155
aVOscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain are the husband-and-wife owners of a small, but growing, fuel oil business in New York City, 1981.
p156
aVIt\u2019s explained that 1981 was one of the most violent years in the city\u2019s history.
p157
aVAnd, a growing source of tension is the highly competitive fuel oil business.
p158
aVDespite the seemingly endless hijackings of his vehicles, Abel Morales (Isaac) is determined not to respond in kind.
p159
aVHe wants peace and prosperity, but it seems like one or more of his competitors wants to drive him out of business.
p160
aVThe financial strain and an ongoing investigation of his company by a local prosecutor adds to the pressure.
p161
aVMorales finds little moral support in his wife, Anna (Chastain).
p162
aVHer late father ran the company like the people he was in business with.
p163
aVSomeone hits you, you hit back.
p164
aVHer husband\u2019s attempts to take the high ground are doubted by not only his wife, but his employees.
p165
aVMorales, nevertheless, attempts to persevere against the violence, decay and corruption.
p166
aVYou would think a film entitled "A Most Violent Year" would bring suspense and action to its intriguing premise, but instead it stubbornly insists on slowing things down to the point that you start thinking about similar films, the Sydney Lumet classic, "Serpico," for example.
p167
aVIsaac just can\u2019t compete with someone like Al Pacino in his prime, at least not with this dull material.
p168
aVAnd, it\u2019s not his fault.
p169
aVIsaac and Chastain will both get kudos for their performances and deserve it.
p170
aVBut, overall, the journey is disappointing for the audience.
p171
aVWe also have a stake in this.
p172
aVI should also mention David Oyelowo as the prosecutor and Albert Brooks as Morales\u2019 attorney and family friend have great scenes in "A Most Violent Year."
p173
aVThere\u2019s no shortage of excellent actors.
p174
aVWriter-director J. C. Chandor shows great promise.
p175
aVIt\u2019s only his third feature film.
p176
aV"All is lost" had pacing problems, but the novelty of Robert Redford as a distressed sailor in a disabled boat adrift hundreds of miles from any port lowered our expectations.
p177
aVIt was an experimental film, even.
p178
aVChandor can continue to sail in his own direction.
p179
aVThere will always be an audience.
p180
aVBut, the sluggishness of his stories will take him only so far with some of us. 
p181
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aMarvel\u2019s latest gamble shows the studio is riding a wave of self-confidence across mountains of cash in the wake of successfully defying Hollywood common sense by hiring directors like cult favourite Shane Black (Iron Man 3) and a couple of guys best known for TV\u2019s Arrested Development and Community (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) to look after some of their most lucrative properties.
p182
aVThey\u2019ve upped the stakes here by pairing James Gunn, director of Slither and Super \u2013 neither of which troubled box office bean counters \u2013 with some of Marvel\u2019s craziest characters in the form of Guardians of the Galaxy, and the result is an exciting thrill-ride that strikes a brilliant balance between jaw-dropping space scenes, anarchic wit and bountiful belly laughs.
p183
aVComing across as perhaps the least shackled by the requirements of a typical origin story of any Marvel film to date, Guardians of the Galaxy quickly dispenses with its dramatic back story right up front, before picking up years later with Peter Quill (the wisecracking Chris Pratt) embarking on a futuristic Indiana Jones-like heist prologue that sets the visually spectacular, quip-heavy tone.
p184
aVFrom here, Gunn\u2019s universe-building proves assured, quickly rolling out all manner of crazy-coloured, CGI and prosthetic-wearing aliens free of any need to keep things grounded for simple Earthlings.
p185
aVBy the time a raccoon and a walking tree turn up and talk to each other it\u2019s just the latest oddity to behold, and the pair become crucial elements of the film\u2019s quintet of heroes (alongside Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista), all of whom boast scene-stealing moments and the charisma to balance Pratt\u2019s star turn.
p186
aVWhile it may lack a great villain, there\u2019s so much awesomeness going on with Guardians that there\u2019s almost no room for one.
p187
aVI\u2019m gunning for part two.
p188
aV Yes, we should."
p189
aVCGI effects create two central characters in "Guardians of the Galaxy."
p190
aVAre you making "Guardians of the Galaxy" for Marvel Comics fans?
p191
aVOr, do you want everyone to come along for the ride?
p192
aVI asked myself those questions and more during a promotional screening of this sure-to-be late summer hit.
p193
aVThe answers left me less than impressed.
p194
aVWhat distinguishes a great adaptation from a mediocre film is its ability to stand apart from the source material.
p195
aV"Guardians of the Galaxy" relied too much on the audience already knowing the Marvel mythology.
p196
aVCall it, in my opinion, an unacceptable shorthand.
p197
aVThe filmmakers substituted mindless action for a good fleshing-out of the story.
p198
aV"Galaxy" opens with the reasonably touching scene of a boy losing his mother to cancer.
p199
aVThe kid has trouble saying goodbye to his mom on her deathbed and instead retreats to his "Sony Walkman" mix tape of hits from the 1970\u2019s.
p200
aVCut to 26 years later and the exploits of a Han Solo/Indiana Jones hybrid out to steal a mysterious orb from an alien planet.
p201
aVWe learn very little about the central character, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt).
p202
aVJust go with it, right?
p203
aVHe\u2019s a righteous space dude who loves 70\u2019s music.
p204
aVYeah, that\u2019s it.
p205
aVWe also learn precious little about the other characters who unite to become the "Guardians of the Galaxy."
p206
aVA few lines of dialogue for each principal.
p207
aVSorry.
p208
aVNo time, folks.
p209
aVWe have at least a dozen villains you need to meet.
p210
aVThe story overflows with characters, all vying for a big onscreen moment.
p211
aVThe cast is pretty good, actually.
p212
aVPratt brings a goofball charm to his Han Solo clone.
p213
aVZoe Saldana goes from the blue makeup of "Avatar" to the amazingly different green makeup of Gamora.
p214
aVUh, okay.
p215
aVDave Bautista wasn\u2019t bad as Drax the Destroyer, a space alien who only understands literal references (similar to Spock in "Star Trek.")
p216
aVVin Diesel (box office poison for any movie that doesn\u2019t have the word "fast" in the title) supplies the voice of Groot, a tree-like humanoid.
p217
aVBradley Cooper provides the comic relief as Rocket, a genetically modified raccoon.
p218
aVThe villains are such generic comic-book stereotypes, I won\u2019t even bother mentioning.
p219
aVOn the positive side, the film has an above-average sense of humor.
p220
aVThe talking raccoon was amusing at times, but annoying at other times.
p221
aVA few of the special effects shots were impressive.
p222
aVBut, they often crowded the story.
p223
aVLess is more sometimes.
p224
aVThe 3D conversion was also above average.
p225
aVOn the negative side, why wasn\u2019t there more of an original score?
p226
aVI realize Quill enjoys his 70\u2019s music.
p227
aVAnd, personally, it\u2019s my favorite decade.
p228
aVBut, it\u2019s lazy to let established pop hits of decades past to stand in for first-rate original music.
p229
aVMusic should help tell the story.
p230
aVEstablished hit singles bring too much baggage.
p231
aVDespite what I might think of the finished product, "Guardians of the Galaxy" will be a huge box office hit.
p232
aVAnd, it will likely break August box office records.
p233
aVAs mindless fun, it works.  
p234
aV British mathematician Alan Turing was a hero decades before actor Benedict Cumberbatch was born.
p235
aVBut, now Turing\u2019s place in history is elevated by the actor\u2019s amazing performance in "The Imitation Game."
p236
aVTuring is cool, because Cumberbatch is cool.
p237
aVThe film trumpets Turing\u2019s key role in winning World War II by breaking Nazi Germany\u2019s Enigma code.
p238
aVMillions of lives were saved by Turing and his team of eggheads at Bletchley Park, northwest of London.
p239
aVNot as well served by the film was Turing\u2019s sexuality.
p240
aVHe was criminally prosecuted for his admitted homosexuality after the war and chemically castrated, ultimately leading to his suicide.
p241
aVBut, the film glosses over his personal preferences and plays up his engagement to Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley).
p242
aVTuring was a troubled soul, but it\u2019s like the filmmakers decided to skip that part in favor of solve, solve, solve\u2026let\u2019s solve the puzzle.
p243
aVMost historians note that Turing and Clarke didn\u2019t have a great love affair.
p244
aVIt\u2019s doubtful that Turing woke up one morning, and realized he was gay.
p245
aVThe film should have acknowledged his sexuality from the start, rather than relying on hints and whispers.
p246
aVCumberbatch is NOT one of my favorites.
p247
aVHis Sherlock Holmes on television annoys me, and so much praise has been heaped upon the actor that it makes me resent having to watch him in this or that.
p248
aVHe\u2019s not even that good-looking, folks.
p249
aVAnd, his farts do NOT smell like roses.
p250
aVBut, with that rant out of my system now, I must say he impresses as Turing.
p251
aVThe role seems custom-made.
p252
aVHis arrogant, but endearing, style makes Turing\u2019s efforts to break the code as fascinating as an original Sherlock Holmes mystery.
p253
aVAnd, despite any shortcomings with the historical accuracy, the top-notch screenplay allows Cumberbatch to nail down every last scene.
p254
aVIt\u2019s remarkable.
p255
aV"The Imitation Game\u2019s" supporting cast shines, particularly Charles Dance and Mark Strong.
p256
aVThe direction by Norway\u2019s Morten Tyldum is excellent.
p257
aVIt\u2019s his first English-language film.
p258
aVIf you\u2019ve never seen "Headhunters," please do.
p259
aVTyldum has a nice touch.
p260
aVI look forward to his future films.
p261
aVAs for "The Imitation Game," you can\u2019t go wrong.
p262
aVA bracing film with excellent production values and a fine cast. 
p263
aV An animated film should entertain kids, while at the same time, appeal to adults.
p264
aVFrequently, adults are left out of the equation.
p265
aVAnd, sometimes the action is so frenetic, that only anklebiters get anything out of it.
p266
aVSuch is the case with "Penguins of Madagascar."
p267
aVYes, penguins are cute.
p268
aVBut, the ones coming out of Dreamworks are also obnoxious and headache-producing.
p269
aVThe mad pacing in "Penguins of Madagascar" exposes a lack of wit and substance.
p270
aVIt is to be endured, not enjoyed.
p271
aVUnless, of course, you are very young.
p272
aVToddlers to ten.
p273
aVThese are the penguins from the "Madagascar" franchise, of course.
p274
aVSkipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights), the rookie.
p275
aVAfter an opening sequence set in Antarctica, the birds break into Fort Knox to find a vending machine with a discontinued hard-to-find snack.
p276
aVNever mind the gold reserves.
p277
aVPenguins move on their stomachs.
p278
aVAfter consuming their fill of the cheesy snacks, the quartet is kidnapped by a talking squid known as Dave.
p279
aVDave despises penguins.
p280
aVThey constantly steal the show away from his inkness, getting him kicked out of zoos all over the world.
p281
aVIt seems Dave used to be the favorite.
p282
aVI don\u2019t know how that happened since penguins have always been around.
p283
aVWhat zoo was Dave at, where he was the main attraction?
p284
aVDave plots to kidnap all zoo penguins and turn them into mutants as revenge for his falling into disfavor.
p285
aVThat\u2019s all you need to know, since the story goes at such a furibund pace, there\u2019s little time to absorb plot points.
p286
aVForget about the story.
p287
aVJust let the kids look at the pretty pictures.
p288
aVWhat would I have done to make "Penguins of Madagascar" more palatable?
p289
aVEasy.
p290
aVSlow things down and concentrate on the jokes.
p291
aVUse the Marx Brothers as a pattern with Skipper as Groucho, Kowalski as Chico, Rico as Harpo and Private as Zeppo (who knows?)
p292
aVMaybe write Private out of the story.
p293
aVInstead of the usual mad scientist (Dave) routine, find something original and funny to write about.
p294
aVUse some wit and fancy, and stop worrying about ADHD.
p295
aVToday\u2019s children will get it.
p296
aVAnd, if they don\u2019t, then concentrate on sending films like "Penguins of Madagascar" direct to cable TV or home entertainment venues.
p297
aVSpare the adults. 
p298
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aWith his "golden age" seeming like a bygone era \u2013 Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, I even like The Waterboy \u2013 and his brief-but-bold dramatic turns feeling more like cliff notes in his career \u2013 Punch Drunk Love, Spanglish \u2013 I want to be able to like Adam Sandler again.
p299
aVBut with his recent releases under Happy Madison Productions, like Jack and Jill and statutory rape comedy That\u2019s My Boy, my seed of respect for the man remains unfertilised.
p300
aVAppropriately, Grown Ups 2 continues that arrested development.
p301
aVSandler\u2019s \u2018A-squad\u2019 is a comedy file cabinet: Chris Rock tells the race jokes, David Spade gets the redneck gags, Kevin James stops the film five times to do a burp sneeze fart.
p302
aVThe talents of Salma Hayek, Maya Rudolph and Maria Bello are ignored as the trio is relegated to "Aw\u2026 Honey\u2026" housewife roles.
p303
aVThe script contains some decent lines, but the leads dampen the delivery with a noticeable lack of energy.
p304
aVIt\u2019s telling when the most charismatic comedic performance comes from Taylor Lautner, who embraces his alpha fraternity douchebag role with some recognisable effort.
p305
aVBut the disturbing aspects of Grown Ups 2 are its mild attempts at sentimentality that seek to promote family values.
p306
aVWhile the film idolises how loved ones come first, it backs that up with Sandler\u2019s character using physical violence as the most appropriate solution in situations that can be easily talked out of.
p307
aVIn a comedy full of poorly executed humour, it makes the entire movie valueless.
p308
aV Now, Disney has trotted out a 3D version and that gives families an excuse to go see swell piece of animation on the big screen again.
p309
aVNever mind I couldn\u2019t really see any significant improvements from the 3D effects.
p310
aVOkay, it\u2019s a revenue thing.
p311
aVEventually, every blessed Disney film will get a 3D showing.
p312
aVAnd, that kind of makes me seasick.
p313
aVAnyway you may remember Nemo is the tiny clown fish with a defective fin.
p314
aVHis dad, voiced by Albert Brooks, is so concerned his little tadpole will be harmed, he never lets Nemo out of his sight.
p315
aVThis, of course, leads to resentment.
p316
aVNemo strikes out on his own, gets lost and then winds up in the aquarium of an Australian dentist.
p317
aVThe story introduces youngsters to the concept of death and rising above one\u2019s disability.
p318
aVIt\u2019s also a very entertaining tale that will NOT bore the adults.
p319
aVOkay, score one for Pixar.  
p320
aV Hollywood breathes a special kind of oxygen, and director David Cronenberg attempts to satirize the goings-on.
p321
aVBut, his efforts to mock show business are just so much vinegar and vulgarity.
p322
aVNothing funny or enlightening in this portrayal of the entertainment industry.
p323
aVBig problem: The film lacks a protagonist.
p324
aVYou could argue that limousine driver Jerome Fontana (Robert Pattinson) fits the bill.
p325
aVBut, very little of the story bounces off his character.
p326
aVThe other roles, Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore), Agatha Weiss (Mia Wasikowska), Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack), Cristina Weiss (Olivia Williams) and Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird) are living too hard in their freaky worlds for anyone to climb into their skins.
p327
aV"Maps to the Stars" is absurdist cinema.
p328
aVHavana is a washed-up actress hoping to get back into the game by starring in a remake of the film that made her late mother famous.
p329
aVShe frequently hallucinates a younger version of her mother.
p330
aVAgatha (Wasikowska) becomes Havana\u2019s personal assistant shortly after arriving in L.A.  Agatha knows Carrie Fisher (cameo appearance) through Twitter, and Fisher recommends her to Havana.
p331
aVDr. Weiss is a celebrity psychologist who gives personal life lessons and training to Havana.
p332
aVCristina, Stafford\u2019s wife, obsesses over the acting career of her son, Benjie.
p333
aVThe teen sensation (Bird) is a horse\u2019s ass in real life.
p334
aVAfter a stint in rehab, he\u2019s now ready to resume his superstar life in a franchise film series called "Bad Babysitter."
p335
aVEveryone behaves badly.
p336
aVEveryone seems to be in an incestuous relationship, some are quite literally.
p337
aVDespite some fine performances, "Maps to the Stars" fails to entertain or even make sense, at times.
p338
aVIt\u2019s more odd than comical.
p339
aVIt\u2019s peculiar without being droll.
p340
aVThe film needed a satisfactory POV.
p341
aVInstead, there\u2019s only a disconnect with the characters. 
p342
aV He nails it.
p343
aVBozeman rises above the material in "Get On Up," now in its home entertainment release.
p344
aVYou may not like the way the story is presented, but you can certainly appreciate the talent involved.
p345
aVThe hardest working man in show business lived a complicated life, but that was no reason to make his story hard to follow.
p346
aVThe screenplay bounces like a ping-pong ball from childhood to prison to manhood to early showbiz to late showbiz to Brown\u2019s mental problems.
p347
aVIt makes you want to scream out for a more linear approach.
p348
aVThere\u2019s nothing wrong with flashbacks and flash forwards.
p349
aVMost movies use at least a flashback or two to help tell their stories.
p350
aVBut, "Get On Up" turns Brown\u2019s life into popcorn.
p351
aVIt\u2019s like catching the kernels as they jump out of the pan.
p352
aVUnless you\u2019re already familiar with the singer\u2019s life, it\u2019s confusing.
p353
aVSo many people were a part of this man\u2019s history.
p354
aVIt deserved a better telling.
p355
aVSo, let\u2019s cover the positive.
p356
aVBoseman.
p357
aVThe guy has talent, and it\u2019s on display.
p358
aVHe captures Brown from start to finish.
p359
aVFrom his early convictions that he could be something special to the excesses of super-stardom.
p360
aVBozeman shows us the doubts, the confidence, the flamboyance, the regrets and the talent (including some amazing dance moves) that made Brown a living legend.
p361
aVThe story doesn\u2019t give us much about Brown\u2019s political activism, although it shows him convincing the mayor of Boston that he should allow Brown\u2019s concert to go ahead shortly after the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s assassination.
p362
aVIt also shows that very concert getting out of hand and how Brown brought things back under control.
p363
aVThe supporting cast in "Get On Up" is excellent, especially a small scene with Brandon Mychal Smith as Little Richard.
p364
aVNow, I\u2019m ready to see Little Richard\u2019s story.
p365
aVLike Boseman, Smith carried the role.
p366
aVYou may not like the way the story is presented, but "Get On Up" gives you insights into Brown\u2019s life.
p367
aVIt\u2019s worth the time of anyone who loves the Godfather of Soul. 
p368
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aGet On Up is at once the most unconventional biopic I\u2019ve ever seen, and a shaggy composite of all of them.
p369
aVThe only real difference is James Brown \u2013 but what a difference James Brown makes.
p370
aVChadwick Boseman dazzles as "The Godfather of Soul" in a performance more Oscar-worthy than Jamie Foxx\u2019s Ray or Will Smith\u2019s Ali.
p371
aVHe channels both the great man and the demons that chased Brown straight onto the stage, moving deftly between showman, manipulator and lost soul.
p372
aVInitially Get On Up threatens to be an extended SNL send-up, with an opening scene depicting a confused latter-era Brown holding a room full of seminar attendees to ransom with a shotgun because one of them used his bathroom (a true story by all accounts).
p373
aVThankfully that\u2019s followed by a more dynamic portrayal of a conflicted and gifted man, punctuated with musical set pieces that are among the best ever created for the screen.
p374
aVIt is with the deepest sympathy then that I understand director Tate Taylor\u2019s reluctance to leave anything on the cutting room floor, but at 140 minutes a more judicious edit would have served it well.
p375
aVStylistically, there are perhaps too many devices \u2013 a broken fourth wall, time-lapse photography, the introduction of chapters with titles, which are presented in a non-linear fashion.
p376
aVWith so much going on the pacing loses its rhythm (there\u2019s no funk in the edit, ironically).
p377
aVAs a result, a lot of what could have been great comedy dialogue falls flaccid, which is a wasted opportunity when you think of how hilarious Brown was as a public figure (see Eddie Murphy\u2019s Delirious for cliff notes).
p378
aVGreat performances are let down by some untidy production but it\u2019s a thrilling ride nonetheless.
p379
aV That comes despite the fact that it appears to have all the right ingredients: a director with bona fides in drawing a solid film from society\u2019s racial past (The Help), a lead actor with the chops to handle a major transformation (Chadwick Boseman, who also played baseball\u2019s barrier-breaker Jackie Robinson in the biopic 42), and a producer who was an associate of the figure in question (Mick Jagger).
p380
aVIt\u2019s too bad, then, that Get On Up comes off like a checklist guide of how not to make a quality biopic.
p381
aVHere are the lessons for future biopic makers.
p382
aV1.
p383
aVDon\u2019t ignore the coke addiction and domestic abuse!
p384
aVThe Godfather of Soul is a complicated figure\u2014evinced by his many, many nicknames\u2014and it was always going to be nearly impossible to take a man best known for transcending stages and capture his essence between the four sides of a big screen.
p385
aVHe cultivated a huge number of backing musicians who went on to be prominent artists; he was a generous and largely kind-hearted man to his friends, family and children; he was a creative genius with a massive ego that was frankly well-earned, helping to birth rap music with his 1969 Funky Drummer being the most sampled beat in hip-hop; he was a racial conciliator who, in one of Get On Up\u2018s finest scenes, arguably prevented Boston from rioting in the immediate wake of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s death.
p386
aVBut he was also a brutal tyrant to his band, who rode on a bus as he took a plane, and he fined them for their mistakes, with his points and hand gestures on stage doubling as notation of band error.
p387
aVHe regularly used PCP and cocaine, a hard-drug problem that was only passingly alluded to in the film by a single shot of Brown rolling cocaine into a cigarette after a personal tragedy.
p388
aVHis relationship with rap was complicated, but not more so than his positions on race: he revered senator Strom Thurmond\u2014who ran for president as a Dixiecrat, to oppose desegregation\u2013saying that he was "like a grandfather."
p389
aVIn the film, racial differences and inequality are largely reduced to punchlines.
p390
aVHe was the Hardest Working Man in Show Business.
p391
aVThat comes with a price\u2014but so much of the film implies that his life and career was essentially an easy coronation, when the reality was so different.
p392
aVInstead of showing his frustrations with a label who refused to give him any meaningful creative control in the early \u201960s, forcing him into the groundbreaking tactics of starting his own label and distribution firm, Get On Up makes it feel like it was an easy fait accompli that he was able to pull off.
p393
aVHe had to push to get heard, push to have his unique sound succeed, and at times push away the people he cared for the most, which can help explain the wild, sad descent of his later years\u2014little of which was represented by the film.
p394
aVAnd by not doing it, the effect is similar to watching his remarkable performances on YouTube as well as the depressing, rambling, context-free interviews of his later days.
p395
aVHagiography, for James Brown, actually does the man a disservice.
p396
aV2.
p397
aVJust tell the bloody story.
p398
aVIt\u2019s not nearly as bad as Wired\u2014the gonzo retelling of the life of John Belushi, curiously told through the perspective of Watergate newsman/Belushi biographer Bob Woodward\u2014but Get On Up frames its story by starting with an inexplicable opening scene of him brandishing a shotgun in an office (details largely fictionalized); Boseman\u2019s Brown even breaks the fourth wall at least three times, which is so rarely a good decision.
p399
aVIts back-and-forth travels through all but the last decade of Brown\u2019s life might have worked if it showed something more profound about the machinations of the man.
p400
aVInstead it highlights the movie\u2019s lack of thesis.
p401
aVThere is, for instance, a moving scene near the end featuring Brown\u2019s mother, who abandoned him when he was young, but it comes so abruptly that it takes a minute to realize what it is you\u2019re even seeing.
p402
aVAnd in one of the final scenes, Boseman\u2019s Brown heads for a stage while thinking out loud, "I paid the cost to be the boss," a classic Brownism.
p403
aVBut in the movie, he has paid no cost at all.
p404
aVThe better approach: Narrow the focus to hone into one aspect, or a few major moments, of the person\u2019s life.
p405
aVLincoln, for instance, eschews the retelling of the president\u2019s rise, opting instead to reflect his character through the single storyline of the congressional fight to end slavery.
p406
aV3.
p407
aVDon\u2019t fall in love with your own star.
p408
aVIt may be the biggest saving grace of Get On Up: the fact that Boseman is a more than capable Brown imitator, embodying his tics, his growl, his bouffant hair, that regal chin, his assuredness in his body\u2019s electric motions, his supreme swagger.
p409
aVWithout that\u2014and some excellent performances by Nelsan Ellis and Viola Davis, the film would be nearly joyless.
p410
aVBut in a way, that\u2019s also its downfall\u2014the film is so clearly in awe of Boseman\u2019s performance that it relies on them at the expense of everything else.
p411
aVIt\u2019s an easy mistake to make in a biopic.
p412
aVConsider Jamie Foxx\u2019s role in Ray, Will Smith\u2019s portrayal of Muhammad Ali, or Ben Kingsley\u2019s embodiment of Mahatma Gandhi: modern biopics tend to build out from how well the lead can emulate the title figure, and work from there.
p413
aVIt\u2019s usually a good thing (unless they fail: see Colin Farrell in Alexander).
p414
aVBut here it just masks the weakness of the underlying film\u2014as Meryl Streep\u2019s Margaret Thatcher did in The Iron Lady.
p415
aV4.
p416
aVYou can\u2019t be everything to everyone\u000aIf Get On Up was made for people who had a serious grounding in funk music, it would mean something that we were seeing portrayals of Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker, who the film largely depicted as self-centred.
p417
aVAnd if it was, it might not need this end title card that comes up at the film\u2019s conclusion: "James Brown was considered one of the most popular artists of all time."
p418
aVAnyone with zero knowledge of James Brown leaves the film without a meaningful sense of just how hard Brown really worked, just how hard it was for Brown to wrest creative control, just how low things got before his late-life renaissance, and just how deeply Brown\u2019s influence is still felt today on pop culture, in the disco, funk and rap genres he helped birth as well as on modern performers\u2019 stagecraft.
p419
aV5.
p420
aVDon\u2019t put yourself in it, for god\u2019s sake\u000aIt\u2019s always a good idea to have someone who knows the figure to make sure that the facts are mostly right, and the narrative is true to itself.
p421
aVTo Mick Jagger\u2019s credit, this film wouldn\u2019t have happened if it wasn\u2019t for his ability to clear the rights, and his experiences playing with and being inspired by Brown come from some authority.
p422
aVBut Jagger wasn\u2019t really all that close with Brown.
p423
aVTake his fondest memory from the last time he saw Brown live, from an interview with the Huffington Post: "I saw him at a show in Cleveland.
p424
aVI can\u2019t remember when, but we were both there together.
p425
aVI went to see his show, and he came to see me.
p426
aVWe had a good time."
p427
aVMoving stuff.
p428
aVNevertheless, there\u2019s a scene in the already-lengthy Get On Up where an actor playing young Jagger nods knowingly at Brown.
p429
aV"I want it to be true to him," Jagger told USA Today about the film.
p430
aVIn this, he certainly failed.
p431
aV Movies great and small for wildly different demographics.
p432
aVBut Toy Story 3 and Winter\u2019s Bone  are both tales of characters terrified of losing their home.
p433
aVIn Toy Story 3, a band of played-out toys are driven out of the house as "their" child heads off to college, and trapped in a daycare gulag.
p434
aVIn Winter\u2019s Bone an intrepid teenage girl trying to save the family house from being sold off plunges into an Ozark mountain underworld in search of her bail-jumping dad.
p435
aVBoth movies are worth seeing.
p436
aVToy Story 3 is a solid sequel to a trusty franchise\u2014a 3D  ride to the dark side of toyland, buffered by sentiment.
p437
aVWith enough wit to amuse the parents and enough adventure to captivate the kids.
p438
aVIt\u2019s had a lot of attention already.
p439
aVSo I\u2019m going to reverse the usual protocol and lead with the little movie, Winter\u2019s Bone (which opens in Toronto today, and expands to Vancouver and Montreal next week)  This Sundance award-winner is a superbly acted, beautifully wrought film.
p440
aVChances are it will be a contender for my Top 10 list by the time winter comes around.
p441
aVTalk about counter-programming.
p442
aVThe farthest thing you could imagine from the bright summer midway of Iron Men and A-Team hijinks and Karate Kids, Winter\u2019s Bone is an austere, harrowing suspense story of a hard-headed girl who ventures into an Ozark heart of darkness, a backwoods hell of crystal meth and family menace and unforgiving cruelty.
p443
aVJennifer Lawrence delivers a powerful, unwavering performance as 17-year-old Ree Dolly, who is trying to track down her father.
p444
aVHe put up their house for a bail bond then vanished without a trace.
p445
aVIf she can\u2019t find him, she will be homeless, along with the rest of her family.
p446
aVAs she heads into woods to question friends and relatives, she runs up against an outlaw code of silence and risks her life with each step that takes her closer to the truth behind her dad\u2019s disappearance.
p447
aVShe confronts her ruthless addict uncle, the incongruously nicknamed Teardrop (John Hawkes), and passes through a declension of ever darkening characters.
p448
aVThe movie\u2019s desaturated palette is expertly controlled.
p449
aVThis is a gray world and we don\u2019t see a glimmer of sun in the sky, or a smile from our resilient heroine, until close to the end.
p450
aVBased on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, the film is set and shot in the mountains of southern Missouri, a world that is captured with stunning authenticity.
p451
aVI was reminded of Canadian director Jennifer Baichwal\u2019s fine documentary, The True Meaning of Pictures: Shelby Adams\u2019 Appalachia.
p452
aVThis film portrays mountain culture with the same photographic richness,  avoiding the hillbilly stereotypes, while etching Gothic character portraits of scary potency.
p453
aVAnd the stark dialogue has an archaic, almost biblical cadence.
p454
aVDirector and co-writer Debra Granik, who shot the film in real Ozark family homes, worried about playing into the stereotypes.
p455
aV"Moonshine and meth," she says, "are gasoline on the bonfire of cliches depicting mountain culture.
p456
aVThirty-five years after Deliverance, even a banjo can still be a loaded symbol.
p457
aVBut in our trips down to southern Missouri, banjos kept popping up in the most mysterious and alluring ways.
p458
aVUltimately the banjo found its way into the film, offering notes of hope and perseverance.
p459
aVI came to think of it as a fresh start for that image."
p460
aVAs for Toy Story 3, it does not depart from the safe formula of the previous installments.
p461
aVDon\u2019t expect anything as ingenious as Ratatouille or Up.
p462
aVBut the formula works.
p463
aVA few brief observations culled from my recent article on sequels and remakes in the magazine:\u000aEach movie in Disney-Pixar\u2019s Toy Story franchise conforms to a strict narrative template: led by Woody (Tom Hanks), the vintage cowboy doll, a clan of animated toys get separated from their beloved master, Andy, and have to fight their way home.
p464
aVIn Toy Story 2, the enemy was a venal collector.
p465
aVIn Toy Story 3, Andy is off to college and his toys are once again playing dodgeball with oblivion.
p466
aVWill it be the attic?
p467
aVA yard sale?
p468
aVNo, they\u2019re donated to a daycare centre\u2014a prison camp ruled with an iron paw by a strawberry-scented stuffed bear.
p469
aVWhile the franchise\u2019s sentimental mould is inviolable, this sequel has a darker, more satirical edge.
p470
aVSome of the Orwellian daycare toys are quite scary, like the mad-eyed, cymbal-crashing monkey on surveillance duty, or the big, blank-eyed baby doll.
p471
aVAnd in an apocalyptic set piece, the toys are sent on a harrowing flume ride through trash shredders to landfill hell.
p472
aVI\u2019m not giving anything away by saying that this Toy Story, like the others, ends happily.
p473
aVSome things will never change.
p474
aV "Boyhood" is the story of a single-parent family, a mother and her two children, made over a 12-year period using the same actors and director.
p475
aVAmazing concept.
p476
aVAnd, even more amazing that Richard Linklater pulled it off.
p477
aVThe Houston filmmaker assembled his cast and crew annually for twelve years to tell the story of a boy growing up in Texas.
p478
aVIt begins with the child in first grade and ends with him making new friends in college.
p479
aVIn fact, the last few spoken words of this film I will remember for the rest of my life.
p480
aVThe cinematic journey is rewarding and markedly profound.
p481
aVAs you might expect, "Boyhood" drops in on its characters annually.
p482
aVIn 2002, six-year-old Mason Evans, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) overhears his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) arguing with her boyfriend about improving her life.
p483
aVShe takes Mason and his older sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston so she can finish college, get a higher-paying  job and make a better living for her family.
p484
aVThe next year Mason\u2019s biological father (Ethan Hawke) drops into their lives after returning to Texas from Alaska.
p485
aVMason Sr. also has some growing up to do.
p486
aVAnd, that\u2019s one of the things you like about "Boyhood," it isn\u2019t just about the boy.
p487
aVAll of the characters created by Linklater progress, some faster than others, over the 12-year span.
p488
aVOlivia repeatedly fails in relationships, but she\u2019s learning.
p489
aVMason\u2019s father matures right in front of your eyes and becomes more responsible.
p490
aVSamantha has a rebellious nature, at times, but is always moving forward.
p491
aVThese people may not be exactly like your own family, but you know them nevertheless.
p492
aVThe emotions feel very real.
p493
aVPatricia Arquette plays Olivia Evans in "Boyhood," the story of young man growing up in Texas.
p494
aVOn the negative side, Linklater\u2019s film often lacks focus.
p495
aVThe scripts were written year-by-year.
p496
aVVery little was determined from the start, just some character traits and the film\u2019s impressive last scene.
p497
aVAt times, you feel like you\u2019re on a casual stroll through these people\u2019s lives.
p498
aVThe authenticity gets mundane at times.
p499
aVThe film\u2019s 2:45 runtime is another negative tick.
p500
aVThe mind begins to wander at times.
p501
aVThe annual segments needed trimming.
p502
aVWhere?
p503
aVHow much?
p504
aVIf I knew for sure, I would be making films, not commenting on them.
p505
aVThe performances are nicely understated.
p506
aVColtrane\u2019s laid back acting style contributed greatly to the film\u2019s truthfulness.
p507
aVArquette\u2019s naturalistic approach gave the movie its heart and soul.
p508
aVShe repeatedly fails in her personal relationships, but not with her children.
p509
aVThey survive because of her soul-searching and good intentions.
p510
aVOverall, a great ensemble.
p511
aVFinally, is "Boyhood" one of the best films of 2014?
p512
aVCertainly, it\u2019s a great film.
p513
aVAnd, many critics have it at the very top of their lists.
p514
aVPersonally, I like Richard Linklater so much that I hope he hasn\u2019t peaked.
p515
aVMaybe "Boyhood" is just a warm-up for something even more remarkable.
p516
aVSomething that can be made in considerably less time,  of course. 
p517
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aBoyhood is a staggering cinematic achievement, all the more so in how readily you\u2019ll lose yourself in this broadly sketched tale of a life rather than pick apart how it has been uniquely assembled.
p518
aVFor twelve years Richard Linklater has been shooting episodically, striking gold all over the place in the process \u2013 most notably in the form of Ellar Coltrane, whose lead performance as Mason is what this ambitious project hinges upon.
p519
aVFollowing Mason from childhood through adolescence, Boyhood doesn\u2019t just capture this young man\u2019s physical and personal growth, but that of the key figures that orbit him: separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke); sister (Lorelei Linklater); and first love (Zoe Graham).
p520
aVWhile Arquette\u2019s performance is a standout, Linklater conjures emotive, naturalistic performances from all his cast, so as the film works its magic and the years pass by, one can\u2019t help but be captivated by the lives unfolding onscreen.
p521
aVThat\u2019s all the more impressive with Boyhood, for the most part, avoiding making the obvious dramatic moves we\u2019re conditioned to expect in film.
p522
aVOne might anticipate seeing Mason\u2019s emotional highs and lows unfold in traditional fashion, but more often than not these pivotal moments take place offscreen, the audience left to ponder the ripples they leave on Mason and his family across time.
p523
aVThat this forward momentum is conveyed more through the years\u2019 contemporary music and the physical changes of Boyhood\u2019s cast is another contributing factor to the film\u2019s unforced feeling as it moves along at a pace of its own.
p524
aVLinklater casts a spell that defies you to not be moved, and captures the incredible complexity, richness and emotion of every one of our unique lives in the process.
p525
aV But some films just may demand that sort of line-in-the-sand passion.
p526
aVBoyhood, the latest from American filmmaker Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, Bernie, School Of Rock), is one.
p527
aVIt\u2019s a film this writer has watched, twice now, largely behind a mist of tears provoked by the film\u2019s grace notes of fuzzy adolescent nostalgia.
p528
aVPlenty has been made of Boyhood\u2019s production.
p529
aVLinklater gathered his cast for a few weeks a year over the course of more than a decade, mapping the adolescence of a Texan boy named Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) in close to real time.
p530
aVThe boy\u2019s aging is marked as much by the acne flecking his face as by progressing pop cultural references (Dragonball Z, Harry Potter, Halo) and political movements (Bush\u2019s Fallujah invasion, the Obama-Biden ticket).
p531
aVImagine Michael Apted\u2019s Up Series (documentaries that catch up with 14 British people every seven years) crossbred with Linklater\u2019s own meandering day-in-the-life surveys (Dazed and Confused, Slacker, the Before trilogy) and you begin to get a sense of the scale of the accomplishment.
p532
aV"Because it\u2019s such a conceptual effort," Malcolm Harris writes in the online magazine The New Inquiry, "it seems almost unfair to judge Boyhood as a narrative feature."
p533
aVBut arguing that Boyhood is something other than a conventional movie, discounting it as "conceptual," glosses over what Linklater has achieved.
p534
aVIn a film that moves without contrivance with the young man at its centre, nothing and everything happens.
p535
aVCharacters learn lessons and grow up and go camping and shoot guns and fall in and out of love\u2014Patricia Arquette, as Mason and Samantha\u2019s upwardly mobile single mom, cycles through husbands, her desire for security drawing her to a string of abusive drunks.
p536
aVLinklater lets these things happen at the unhurried pace of time itself.
p537
aVHe even lets plot threads develop in ellipses, suggesting micro-dramas in the spaces we don\u2019t see, as when a teenage Mason Jr. argues with his dad about his rightful claim to a vintage GTO, promised to him (so he argues) in a scene we never see.
p538
aVIn films like School of Rock, Linklater has expressed a rare sensitivity to what one Boyhood character calls the "voluptuous panic" of youth.
p539
aVKids are free to drink beer and smoke pot and horse around without the hand of narrative repercussion slamming down.
p540
aVAs in Bernie, Slacker and Waking Life, Boyhood empathizes with the oddballs that dot the periphery of a certain American adolescence: the Tourettic loners stalking the suburbs, the conspiracy theorists slumped in the booths of all-night diners, the Bible-thumping backwoods Texans more commonly rendered as no-dimensional caricatures.
p541
aVWatching these characters orbit in and out of one another\u2019s lives gives a sense of actually watching people\u2014not canned archetypes, but fully formed people\u2014get older.
p542
aVTime\u2019s movement over the film establishes an uncommon intimacy with its cast, a sense that we truly know them.
p543
aVIt feels like a consummate work for Linklater, who has long been engrossed with the spaces people occupy, how they change over time\u2014whether in the all-night party of Dazed and Confused or the 18 years separating Before Sunrise from Before Midnight.
p544
aVHe even has the indolent liquor-store clerk from Dazed reprise his role, suggesting that all his films take place in the same narrative world.
p545
aVThis proximity is the core of Boyhood, and it\u2019s more impressive than managing a cast\u2019s schedules for 10-plus years or making nine feature films while shooting it.
p546
aVThe gimmick becomes invisible, and Boyhood feels less conceptual than classical: form and narrative in harmony.
p547
aVRare is a \ufb01lm that\u2019s so bottomless in its generosity and affection.
p548
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aRon Howard\u2019s Rush is an exuberant, diverting dramatisation of the legendary rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) over the course of the fateful Grand Prix season of 1976.
p549
aVIts combo of hair-raising behind-the-wheel action, heated off-track controversies and stormy relationship soap is hardly earth-shattering stuff, but Howard and writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) do squeeze sufficient dramatic tension out of the opponents\u2019 wildly different temperaments, while acknowledging their shared sense of purpose and conviction.
p550
aVHunt is the blonde-and-blue-eyed Brit, a hard-partying, hot-headed playboy with raw driving talent to spare; Lauda, on the other hand, is a brusquely pragmatic Austrian who doesn\u2019t have time for social frivolities, single-mindedly focused on the race to a fault.
p551
aVHemsworth and Brühl are both terrific, portraying the escalating competitive ribbing between the pair with good humour and genuine passion.
p552
aVPredictably, the women get sidelined: Olivia Wilde is wasted as Hunt\u2019s model girlfriend Suzy Miller, Joséphine de La Baume\u2019s role as Lauda\u2019s wife ultimately reduced a series of wordless glances, which admittedly, she does remarkably well.
p553
aVTechnically, Howard doesn\u2019t do anything that John Frankenheimer didn\u2019t already achieve with Grand Prix back in 1966, but some of it sure is dang pretty: armed with Dogme veteran/regular Danny Boyle cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, Rush\u2019s racing sequences are gussied up with expressionistic splashes of hot, saturated colour that heighten the nerve-rattling, feverishly adrenalised view from inside the cockpit.
p554
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aSet to be Wes Anderson\u2019s highest-earning film, The Grand Budapest Hotel follows on the heels of the also successful Moonrise Kingdom in matching his now-familiar odd-bod aesthetic with a mainstream audience.
p555
aVBut where Moonrise was awash with wistful nostalgia in its take on adolescence, romance and scouting, Anderson\u2019s latest mines its period setting in service of a broadly comical tale which enjoys frequent diversions into both black and off-colour humour even as a body count amasses and the Second World War threatens to intrude on the borders of the titular hotel\u2019s fictitious homeland.
p556
aVThe cast list deceptively points to another sprawling ensemble effort, but despite the bountiful number of familiar faces on display and the amount of wandering in time and aspect ratio the film does, its arguably the most fixed around an individual performance of any Anderson pic since Rushmore.
p557
aVIn a rare comic lead performance, Ralph Fiennes throws himself into a character that, thanks to Anderson\u2019s screenplay, frequently offers unexpected laughs.
p558
aVAs Mr Gustave \u2013 hotel concierge, elderly guests\u2019 "companion", perfume enthusiast and over-user of the word "darling" \u2013 Fiennes makes full use of the character\u2019s ambiguity in class, legality, manners and sexuality, aided by whip-smart dialogue and a welcome eagerness to ham things up when required.
p559
aVUnmistakably Anderson in style and tone, complete with some hilarious The Fantastic Mr Fox-sque moments, it\u2019s satisfying to see this level of craftsmanship applied to a film that is often so silly it\u2019s a pure delight to watch.
p560
aV From the Vietnam pyrotechnics of the school play in Rushmore, to the pup-tent puppy love of Moonrise Kingdom, Anderson gift-wraps his stories as worlds within worlds, homemade pageants of kooky artifice.
p561
aVAnd he seems blissfully immune to trends.
p562
aVWhile Hollywood doubles down on the manifest destiny of 3D, Anderson perversely flattens cinematic reality into confectionary dioramas, mille feuille layers of faux naïf make-believe.
p563
aVWith every film, the art house becomes his dollhouse.
p564
aVHis movies seem to take place in an alternate reality, a world that is as Andersonian as Cronenberg\u2019s is Cronenbergian.
p565
aVIt\u2019s an acquired taste, one that I began to un-acquire somewhere between the Gotham bubble of The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and the Nemo-on-acid odyssey of The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004).
p566
aVBy the time an all-too-prescient Owen Wilson popped up as bandaged suicide survivor in the railway escapade of The Darjeeling Limited (2007), I felt Anderson had lost his way.
p567
aVIt\u2019s not just that the pick-up-sticks narrative was so archly contrived; it presented such a maze of tones and tangents that it was hard to get grip on the characters, or believe they were anything more than the constructs of an over-active imagination.
p568
aVWith the exhilarating romp of The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), all of a sudden the director found his groove\u2014by making a cartoon weirdly lifelike, rather than making life weirdly cartoon-like.
p569
aVThen, with Moonrise Kingdom (2012), it all came together.
p570
aVHe emerged from a career of smoke and mirrors to craft an off-kilter coming-of-age tale that was unusually grounded.
p571
aVInstead of building the story around adults acting like children, for once he gave us children acting like adults, juvenile eccentrics playing house on a wild frontier.
p572
aVAnd even though their elopement was acted out in a mock Godard fantasy camp, the narrative framed tender moments of precocious romance with compositions that popped like still-life tableaux.
p573
aVIn The Grand Budapest Hotel, Anderson\u2019s eighth feature, the director invests his trademark whimsy with spectacular ambition, and the result is the most richly entertaining film of his career.
p574
aVIt\u2019s certainly his most extravagant\u2014in the scale of its cast, its staging and its story.
p575
aVComposed with the cut-gem focus of Moonrise Kingdom and fired with the zany, kinetic spirit of Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel can be seen as an organic extension of his previous work.
p576
aVBut his universe expands dramatically: the windows of this hotel are thrown wide open onto to a larger world.
p577
aVSaoirse Ronan in \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel\u2019\u000aThis hyper-stylized caper movie could give Baz Luhrmann a run for his money.
p578
aVIt was inspired by Vienna\u2019s Stefan Zweig, a famous writer and dandy from the first half of the 20th century, who counted Freud among his friends, and who, according to biographer George Prochnik, wore alligator shoes, wrote with violet ink and wrote an essay about Handel that he had printed entirely on silk.
p579
aVIn his spirit, the movie and its hero\u2014an over-cultured concierge played with breathtaking panache by Ralph Fiennes\u2014are ridiculously ornate.
p580
aVThe Grand Budapest Hotel is, of course, not in Budapest.
p581
aVThe story is centred in a fictional spa town in a made-up Alpine country called Zubrowka, which seems to float between a distant belle époque and the Nazi and Stalinist scourges of the 1930s.
p582
aVBut Zubrowka also recalls any number of imaginary places of cinematic delirium, from the Marx brothers\u2019 Freedonia (Duck Soup) to Guy Maddin\u2019s Mandragora (Twilight of the Ice Nymphs).
p583
aVIn its broad hotel corridors, there is even a glimmer of The Shining.
p584
aVAnd Anderson says he took some cues from the pre-Code comedies of the 1930s.
p585
aVBut once again, the world he creates is uniquely his own.
p586
aVWillem Dafoe (left) and Adrian Brody in \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel\u2019\u000aThe story unfolds as a nested-doll narrative that spans three generations, each framed with its own aspect ratio.
p587
aVWe run through a declension of storytellers, from the author (Tom Wilkinson) to the young writer (Jude Law) to a mysterious patron of the hotel named Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), our chief raconteur, who takes us back to the day he was recruited as a hotel lobby boy (Tony Revolori) by the flamboyant Gustave (Fiennes).
p588
aVWhat triggers the action is the sudden death of an 84-year-old dowager countess named Madame D (Tilda Swinton), one of Gustave\u2019s most cherished paramours in a harem that seems unrestricted by age or gender.
p589
aVThe lady leaves him a priceless painting.
p590
aVWhen Gustave and his lobby boy show up to claim it, they run afoul of Madame D\u2019s son, the villainous Dimitri (Adrian Brody), and the chase is on.
p591
aVThis madcap farce ricochets between world wars, and involves 16 characters, almost every one of them played by an A-list actor.
p592
aVThey include Bill Murray (desk clerk), Edward Norton (police captain), Harvey Keitel (bald crime boss), Jeff Goldblum (Freud-like lawyer), Saoirse Ronan (Zero\u2019s sweetheart, with a birthmark that looks like a map of Mexico on her cheek), and Willem Dafoe in Gestapo-black leather (a Lurch-like killer with a Luger).
p593
aVSuch a thickly populated confection could easily collapse under its weight.
p594
aVBut Anderson choreographs the action, and the comedy, with balletic precision, while a kaleidoscopic array of scenic eye candy rolls by.
p595
aVThe film\u2019s greatest revelation is Ralph Fiennes.
p596
aVWho knew that the star of The English Patient, who brought such sombre gravitas to so many period pieces, had such a light comic touch?
p597
aVHis dialogue is a debonair as his dress, and he lets the pensées slide off his tongue with an air of wry decadence.
p598
aVLines like: "There\u2019s no point doing anything in life because it\u2019s all over in the blink of an eye."
p599
aVOr: "There are faint glimmers of civilization in this vast slaughterhouse of what was once known as humanity."
p600
aVOr, even simple commands like "Take your hands off my lobby boy!"
p601
aVThis actor who once personified fascism to such chilling effect in Schindler\u2019s List, also gets to make fun of Nazis.
p602
aVAnd it\u2019s comforting to know that Nazis are once again fair game for farce.
p603
aV First, it was nine seasons on CBS with a top rated show about the famed defense attorney.
p604
aVThen, he shuttled over to NBC for a few seasons as Robert Ironside.
p605
aVBut, then people just couldn\u2019t get over the way Mason handled himself in the courtroom.
p606
aVIt was time to bring Burr into some very nicely conceived TV movies.
p607
aVAdd Barbara Hale as Mason\u2019s executive assistant, Della Street, and you\u2019re in nostalgia heaven.
p608
aVPeople loved these TV movies, despite the poor to mediocre writing.
p609
aVWho cares if the plotting is a bit obvious and not nearly as accomplished as in the CBS series.
p610
aVThis is all about characters you love and seeing them in their twilight years.
p611
aV"Perry Mason Movie Collection, Volume 1\u2033 has the first six TV movies: "Perry Mason Returns," "The Case of the Notorious Nun," "The Case of the Shooting Star," "The Case of the Lost Love," "The Case of the Sinister Spirit," and "The Case of the Murdered Madam."
p612
aVAll of them are a bit clunky.
p613
aVThe costumes and hairstyles are so eighties.
p614
aVAdd some really memorable guest stars along with series regular, private eye Paul Drake, Junior (William Katt) and all is forgiven.
p615
aVThe six-movie set is on three discs and it\u2019s priced way, way too high at $58.99.
p616
aVHopefully, after it\u2019s been out awhile, the price will come down.
p617
aVIf it doesn\u2019t, only hardcore Mason fans will pay that kind of money.
p618
aVC\u2019mon.
p619
aVIt\u2019s not like these movies aren\u2019t still being shown on television.  
p620
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aFans of Robert Rodriguez\u2019s bold 2005 masterwork Sin City have been clamouring for a follow-up for almost ten years.
p621
aVI was one of them.
p622
aVNow that I\u2019ve seen the late-arriving sequel, I can\u2019t for the life of me work out why I ever thought it would be a good idea.
p623
aVIt\u2019s difficult to identify exactly what this film lacks that its predeccessor possessed \u2013 they both look and sound the same \u2013 but there\u2019s a definite lack of weightiness to the stories, most of which feel like they\u2019re comprised of scenes deleted from the first film for being too boring.
p624
aVThe vignette following Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u2019s gambler as he squares off against the great Powers Boothe initially displays potential, but it goes absolutely nowhere.
p625
aVAs the titular (sorry) femme fatale, French actress Eva Green has the most fun, just as she did in this year\u2019s other Frank Miller adaptation sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire.
p626
aVWhat joy there is to be found here generally comes from her.
p627
aVAnd trying to work out where Mickey Rourke\u2019s make-up ends and Mickey Rourke\u2019s face begins.
p628
aVSin City\u2018s stylised noir-inflections felt like a breath of fresh air in 2005.
p629
aVThe film\u2019s iconic status should remain unvarnished by this underwhelming follow-up.
p630
aV Oh, there\u2019s always loads of suspense in his films, but never complacency.
p631
aVThat\u2019s what I love about his movies, and "Gone Girl" is no exception.
p632
aV"Gone Girl" is a psychological thriller based on the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the screenplay.
p633
aVIt\u2019s the breathtaking story of a husband (Ben Affleck) who\u2019s believed responsible for the kidnapping and presumed death of his wife (Rosamund Pike).
p634
aVNick Dunne (Affleck) has an abrasive personality.
p635
aVHe can be charming when he needs to be, but always seems to be hiding a sly temperament underneath.
p636
aVHe\u2019s not always successful disguising his true nature.
p637
aVHis wife, Amy (Pike), is a smart and apparently upbeat woman who happily moves to Missouri with her husband, so he can be close to his dying mother.
p638
aVOn the couple\u2019s fifth anniversary, Amy disappears from their home after an apparent struggle.
p639
aVHer disappearance becomes a national obsession.
p640
aVShe was the inspiration for a series of children\u2019s books written by her father and mother.
p641
aVThe story progresses at a speedy clip, despite the film\u2019s 2-and-a-half hour runtime.
p642
aVFincher, with Flynn\u2019s help, created a complex, logical shocker that leaves you restless, but attentive.
p643
aVEven when you\u2019re given significant pieces of the puzzle and an overall image of it comes into view, it\u2019s anything goes until the end.
p644
aVThere\u2019s an answer for everything as well.
p645
aVI can\u2019t remember a single thing that can\u2019t be adequately explained with just a little thought.
p646
aVAnd, for someone who\u2019s compulsively chained to logic, like myself, that\u2019s important.
p647
aV"Gone Girl" has plenty to say about how the media plays a role in celebrated criminal cases.
p648
aVMissi Pyle is Ellen Abbott, a cable TV host based on HLN\u2019s Nancy Grace.
p649
aVAnd, yes, she is disgusting.
p650
aVIt\u2019s a timely commentary on how high-profile crimes often get tried on tabloid television.
p651
aVNot pretty.
p652
aVThe casting is pretty much perfect.
p653
aVAffleck is playing a version of himself, or at least how the public and press imagine he might be.
p654
aVRosamund Pike does an admirable job with her complicated character.
p655
aVI\u2019m not so sure it was Oscar-worthy, but she did get the nomination.
p656
aVAnd, I\u2019m okay with that.
p657
aVRest of the cast does a fine job.
p658
aVTyler Perry was surprisingly aces as Nick\u2019s celebrity attorney.
p659
aV"Gone Girl" is yet another awesome accomplishment by one of the best directors working today.
p660
aVThe film excites and entertains with an ending that\u2019s surprising to say the least. 
p661
aV There are very few likeable people in Gone Girl, David Fincher\u2019s film adaptation of Gillian Flynn\u2019s bestselling book, which may explain its critical acclaim.
p662
aVBad characters are in vogue these days: not as foils to good characters or as animate morality lessons about the dangers of drugs and crime, but as protagonists who finish first, unscathed and unrepentant.
p663
aVFrom Breaking Bad to The Wolf of Wall Street to House of Cards (the first two episodes of which Fincher directed), moral ambiguity in the movies and on TV is now a mark of sophistication and depth.
p664
aVBy these standards, then, Gone Girl is the deepest movie ever made.
p665
aVThe film\u2019s protagonist, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), is an aloof, misogynistic hipster (he owns a bar called the Bar) who doesn\u2019t appear remotely distraught when his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary.
p666
aVHe is irritated when he finds his front door wide open, his glass coffee table smashed in, and his wife mysteriously absent\u2014but he isn\u2019t scared; a sign in the minds of police and the media that he may be hiding something.
p667
aVFincher\u2019s film begins as Flynn\u2019s book does, in Nick\u2019s irrefutably creepy voice.
p668
aVHe wishes he could open his wife\u2019s "finely shaped head," he tells us, and extract some answers to the questions that "stormcloud over every marriage.
p669
aV\u2018What are you thinking?
p670
aVWho are you?
p671
aVWhat have we done to each other?\u2019 " Amy is a waifish, nagging, spoiled New Yorker, resentful of Nick for moving them from Manhattan to his sleepy Missouri hometown after the recession.
p672
aVWe are to believe, based on a sequence of flashbacks and voiceovers reminiscent of Desperate Housewives (these are substitutes for Amy\u2019s diary entries in the book) that Nick and Amy were once in love, but even their tender moments are laced with foreboding.
p673
aVWhat makes Gone Girl, in its earlier moments, such an engaging mystery is the unreliable narration.
p674
aVIn print and on screen, we shift back and forth between Amy and Nick\u2019s voices, equally wary of both but hopeful that their skewed versions of events will give us insight into who they are and potentially, what has become of Amy.
p675
aVDid Nick kill her?
p676
aVOr is he innocent, and simply relieved she is gone?
p677
aVNick claims Amy is a demanding shrew, and Amy claims Nick is absent and angry, verging on abusive.
p678
aVThe competing narration is evidence that marriage is a mystery unto itself, with or without a missing persons case.
p679
aVUnfortunately this is when Flynn, who adapted the screenplay from her book, drops the cheap, anachronistic bomb on us: Amy, it turns out, isn\u2019t merely an unreliable narrator in the same obfuscating fashion as Nick.
p680
aVShe is an inadmissible narrator: a comically insane femme fatale whose version of events isn\u2019t sanitized to win us over, but fabricated almost in its entirety to incriminate Nick.
p681
aVShe morphs instantly from a real person into a caricature from one of Tyler Perry\u2019s Biblical revenge allegories, a sociopath who makes false rape accusations and penetrates herself with a wine bottle in order to mimic signs of "forced entry."
p682
aV(Ironically, Perry plays the only likeable character in Gone Girl, hot-shot defence attorney Tanner Bolt).
p683
aVFlynn\u2019s foray into Fatal Attraction territory has caused controversy since the book\u2019s release in 2012.
p684
aVSome critics accused the author, a Missouri native like her protagonist, of being anti-feminist.
p685
aVThe limitations of film are especially unkind to Amy\u2019s character, who is "stripped of her self-justification" when adapted to screen, writes Amanda Dobbins in Vulture.
p686
aVFlynn has defended her villainous heroine by lamenting the lack of complex women characters in literature.
p687
aV"Isn\u2019t it time to acknowledge the ugly side?"
p688
aVshe writes in an essay on her website.
p689
aV"I\u2019ve grown so weary of the spunky heroines, brave rape victims, soul-searching fashionistas that stock so many books."
p690
aVWell, I\u2019ve grown weary of the woman scorned.
p691
aVA heroine willing to set the world on fire to punish her inattentive, philandering husband is a cliché far greater and older than Eat Pray Love.
p692
aVGone Girl may begin a smart and promising mystery, but it ends a misogynistic wet dream.
p693
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aAs a fan of Gillian Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl, the notion of David Fincher bringing her twist-laden, guilt-infused novel to the big screen was a perfect fit.
p694
aVDitto for Ben Affleck\u2019s casting as the often slimy, only semi-sympathetic and sometimes ill-advisedly smirking Nick Dunne, and Rosamund Pike his missing, put-upon wife Amy.
p695
aVWith former Entertainment Weekly TV writer Flynn herself penning the screenplay and the likes of Neil Patrick Harris, Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit, Tyler Perry and Scoot McNairy popping up amongst the supporting cast, all signs pointed to a quality adaptation and Gone Girl does not disappoint.
p696
aVThere\u2019s little room for Fincher-isms here.
p697
aVWith a ton of story to get through, his directorial flourishes feel limited to precise, eerie lighting of scenes that are more pacey than he usually delivers \u2013 and for good reason, since Gone Girl feels like it moves along at a clip, yet still clocks in at 2 hours and 29 minutes.
p698
aVIt\u2019s the most straight-forward film Fincher\u2019s made since Panic Room, and even that boasted the sort of showiness that\u2019s not on offer here.
p699
aVInstead the director seems content to let the narrative do the work, doing justice to the pulpy story by not getting himself between moviegoers and Affleck\u2019s perfectly-suited performance.
p700
aVUnexpectedly funny at times and happy to linger on its bloodiest moments, Gone Girl is perfectly capable of surprises (including blink-and-you\u2019d-miss-it shots of two leading men\u2019s junk) that punctuate Flynn\u2019s twisted tale with venomous glee.
p701
aVA totally different beast to Fincher\u2019s arguably unnecessary The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this superior thriller arrives at a time when Hollywood mostly seems to have forgotten how to make \u2018em.
p702
aV That\u2019s an understatement.
p703
aVBut, you have to admire its power at the box office.
p704
aVFans of Suzanne Collins\u2019 books are loyal to the films.
p705
aVAttention must be paid.
p706
aVYet.
p707
aVI continue to have problems with the pompousness of the Capital City and the excessive sentimentality of the freedom fighters.
p708
aVThat signals dishonesty.
p709
aVAnd, "Mockingjay" is just loaded with spurious emotions.
p710
aVPart I of "Mockingjay" is mostly about war propaganda.
p711
aVThe rebels want to win the hearts and minds of the masses as a way to foment revolution.
p712
aVBut, the lack of enthusiasm expressed by our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is meant to endear us to her.
p713
aVBut, you can\u2019t BUY her emotions, damn you!
p714
aVShe\u2019s the heavyweight hero and can\u2019t be manipulated into false emotions.
p715
aVI found the propaganda storyline quite absurd.
p716
aVAnd, speaking of silly, did you see Donald Sutherland?
p717
aVHe\u2019s still "The Hunger Games" best walking sight gag as President of Panem.
p718
aVI can\u2019t help but laugh out loud, even before he speaks.
p719
aVHow are we supposed to be afraid of someone is such a silly fop?
p720
aVAnd, basically that goes for everyone in the Capital City.
p721
aVEven Everdeen\u2019s true love, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutchinson), looks trifling in his new big-city duds.
p722
aVHe\u2019s now the reluctant spokesman for Sutherland\u2019s tyrannical leader.
p723
aVThe capital is full of peacocks, and it\u2019s difficult to believe they could be in charge of an entire nation.
p724
aVThe late Philip Seymour Hoffman is not well-served in his final performance as Plutarch Heavensbee.
p725
aVHe\u2019s supposed to be one of the masterminds of the revolution.
p726
aVInstead he comes off as the blowhard champion of all things Katniss.
p727
aVIsn\u2019t she amazing?
p728
aVGosh, darn you!
p729
aVThe direction by Francis Lawrence ("Water for Elephants") is overcranked.
p730
aVIt\u2019s obvious there wasn\u2019t enough material to make two films and, so, the first is relegated to being a set-up piece.
p731
aVFrom a marketing standpoint, two parts is pure magic.
p732
aVEveryone pays twice to see a single adaptation.
p733
aVWhen a box office behemoth is involved, two paid admissions are better than one.
p734
aV"The Hunger Games" are almost over.
p735
aVWe are near the end.
p736
aVAnd, I see a world where all are dandified with smelly leotards and jazzy wigs.
p737
aVIt\u2019s the future, baby. 
p738
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aDeparting from the battle royale format of the two previous Hunger Games instalments, Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 plunges the franchise into deeper terrain.
p739
aVFiguratively, with the pic continuing Katniss Everdeen\u2019s trauma-fuelled mental disintegration and its subject matter becoming bleaker and more violent, as well as the literally underground setting in which much of Mockingjay\u2019s talk of revolution plays out.
p740
aVAgainst this deep bunker backdrop the cast spend a lot of time sporting unflattering jumpsuits and talking about what is to come in the next chapter, truncated storytelling that hampers this working as a standalone pic.
p741
aVYes, there is plenty of narrative to work through, and the performances and events that unfold deserve the breathing space that splitting Mockingjay into two films allows.
p742
aVBut that makes for all build-up and little payoff, lacking a blockbuster set piece finale (even as it tries to make the most of a rebellion skirmish and an aerial commando raid).
p743
aVThankfully there\u2019s an emotional climax, a cliffhanger that\u2019s less deflating than that of Catching Fire and will further enthuse the audience to see Part 2 - not that they really need any assistance at this point.
p744
aVDirector Francis Lawrence continues his knack for avoiding obvious, emotionally overwrought moments, something he\u2019s aided considerably in by Lawrence\u2019s expectedly excellent performance.
p745
aVThe whole franchise has benefited immensely from the inner turmoil she brings to life, and no more so than here.
p746
aVFor swathes of the film, Katniss has little to do but react to the actions of others, though she does get to blow stuff up with her bow and enjoy a literal save the cat moment.
p747
aVAnd until Part 2, that\u2019s the most you\u2019re gonna get.
p748
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aNever has a nearly-three-hour blockbuster enthralled me in the way that Interstellar did.
p749
aVAfter the grim seriousness and plodding pacing of his Dark Knight films, where Christopher Nolan did his damnedest to provide a real world for an utterly ridiculous character to play in, it\u2019s a relief to see him freed from such constraints.
p750
aVNot that there isn\u2019t solid science underpinning Interstellar\u2019s world-building (and departing), in fact there\u2019s a ton of it.
p751
aVThose not interested in cosmological hows and whys may find the necessary infodumps all too frequent, but where Interstellar eclipses Nolan\u2019s creativity as seen onscreen previously is in the sense of awe, wonder and spectacle he\u2019s able to conjure on this trip into the unknown.
p752
aVThat the film veers all over the place is, to me, one of the things that justifies its length.
p753
aVGiving himself more of that precious resource, time, to play with (and jettisoning the expected training montage second act), Nolan gets to introduce A-list actors late, indulge in sub-plots that don\u2019t emerge until the final half hour, and take us to some truly spectacular places along the way.
p754
aVThe cast are good, if not outright great.
p755
aVAs with other Nolan pics, his ability to construct strong characters powered by real emotion is lacking.
p756
aVLuckily the likes of McConaughey, Chastain, Caine and even Hathaway (mostly) bring plenty to their performances.
p757
aVPerhaps this is all sounding ho hum to you.
p758
aVBut if space travel, sci-fi and visual spectacle appeal, you can\u2019t look past this triumph of the imagination where the wondrous universe is the true star.
p759
aVInterstellar renders this semi-palatable for mainstream consumption thanks to co-writers Jonathan Nolan and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne.
p760
aVAdd a director who may not have the singularity of vision possessed by Kubrick (himself flawed), and you\u2019ve still got one of the most watchable self-indulgent projects in ages.
p761
aV "Interstellar" almost makes it.
p762
aVBut, the science fiction adventure film has problems after take-off.
p763
aV"Interstellar" is a flawed but fascinating journey featuring plot elements that seem more Spielbergian than Nolanesque.
p764
aVAnd, an outrageously unbalanced sound design becomes a major distraction late in the film.
p765
aVMore on that, later.
p766
aVA memorable sci-fi has to be more than just special effects.
p767
aVThe story needs to equal all the razzle-dazzle.
p768
aV"Interstellar" feels like someone else\u2019s film, a Spielberg retread.
p769
aVThe story opens with a widower (Matthew McConaughey) trying to keep his family unit functioning while the world literally crumbles into dust clouds.
p770
aVEarth needs food to feed its seven billion residents.
p771
aVAnd, that means family farms are of the utmost importance.
p772
aVFormer engineer/astronaut Cooper (McConaughey) lives in a low-tech world that doesn\u2019t need space travel anymore.
p773
aVTechnology is on the fritz.
p774
aVSo, Cooper manages the family farm with his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and his two children, Murph and Tom.
p775
aVAfter a strange gravitational event in his daughter\u2019s bedroom, Cooper and Murph (Mackenzie Foy) hit the road to find a secret NASA operation planning an intergalactic mission.
p776
aVIt\u2019s no surprise that Steven Spielberg was interested in this project, since it reportedly was written for him.
p777
aVAnd, the first 45 minutes is basically "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," minus the giant mound of mashed potatoes.
p778
aVCo-screenwriter Jonathan Nolan (Christopher\u2019s brother) likely added the family/unearthly message elements as a way to attract and/or appease Spielberg.
p779
aVSo, when Christopher Nolan took over as director, the Spielberg elements needed to go.
p780
aVIt\u2019s not his movie anymore.
p781
aVNolan would be better served with a complete rewrite.
p782
aVWhen Cooper agrees to pilot a spaceship through a wormhole in a frantic effort to find a new habitable planet, that\u2019s when the story gets interesting.
p783
aVAt the secret NASA operation, he meets his old professor (Michael Caine), the man with most of the answers.
p784
aVThe crew of the Endurance includes the professor\u2019s daughter, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway).
p785
aVRest of the story I will leave to you.
p786
aVBecause, despite my complaints, I don\u2019t want to keep you from seeing this film or ruin the discovery process.
p787
aVKeep in mind, Nolan\u2019s worst film is better than most of the crap coming out of Hollywood these days.
p788
aVNolan used IMAX cameras for much of this production, and it shows.
p789
aVThe photography is spectacular.
p790
aVThe special effects are awesome.
p791
aVSo, what happened with Zimmer\u2019s score?
p792
aVIt was overpowering in key scenes.
p793
aVI couldn\u2019t understand the dialogue.
p794
aVYou could hear the characters speaking, but you could NOT comprehend what they were saying.
p795
aVNolan says he planned it that way.
p796
aVHard to believe, unless he\u2019s gone nuts.
p797
aVThe acting in this space saga is quite excellent.
p798
aVEspecially, McConaughey.
p799
aVHe is the perfect everyman to go on this adventure.
p800
aVAny praise he gets for this film is well-deserved.
p801
aVFinally, the running time is 169 minutes.
p802
aVThat\u2019s over three hours, folks.
p803
aVThe story would have been better served with more specifics on why the earth was becoming uninhabitable.
p804
aVThe takeaway from "Interstellar" is that Christopher Nolan is human after all.
p805
aVIt\u2019s a trip marred by sound distortion, but still worthwhile. 
p806
aV "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" was poorly received by critics when it debuted, so does it fare any better with its new up-conversion?
p807
aVNot really.
p808
aVThe sci-fi adventure contains so many mistakes in casting, characters and direction, it\u2019s still terribly difficult to like.
p809
aVThe story is basically sound.
p810
aVBut, writer-director George Lucas should have delegated the screenplay and piloting to someone more experienced and savvy.
p811
aVSo many mistakes along the way.
p812
aVSince this is only a summary, and not an essay or formal review, let me short-list the major disappointments:\u000a1.
p813
aVDumbing it down for small children.
p814
aVThat includes the disaster they call Jar Jar Binks.
p815
aVBut, also the flawed performance of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker.
p816
aV2.
p817
aVActors being allowed to perform badly: Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Samuel L. Jackson and Lloyd all needed help from a good director.
p818
aVThey didn\u2019t get it.
p819
aV3.
p820
aVThe writing.
p821
aVDull, stilted and childish.
p822
aVOn the positive side:\u000a1.
p823
aVGood performances from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Ray Park.
p824
aV2.
p825
aVDarth Maul was truly something to get excited about.
p826
aVHe was a product of technology and competent acting skills.
p827
aV3.
p828
aVThe fight scenes were well-executed and absorbing.
p829
aV4.
p830
aVTech credits are just what you would expect from George Lucas.
p831
aVSo, how was the 3D?
p832
aVNo better than any other film up-converted to the format.
p833
aVYour eyes strain to spot any differences from the original film.
p834
aVBut, after a while you just sit back and watch it like any other film.\u000a
p835
aV Turner in Mike Leigh\u2019s "Mr.
p836
aVTurner."
p837
aVI\u2019m certainly not an expert on 19th century British painters, but I can imagine that "Mr. Turner" is made with such care that it could be a wonderful introduction to art students studying the life of Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851).
p838
aVDirector Mike Leigh and actor Timothy Spall have painted their own masterpiece.
p839
aVTurner\u2019s genius was established early in his career, and Leigh chose to focus on the latter half of the artist\u2019s life when he became even better known and more eccentric.
p840
aVTurner\u2019s devotion to his ailing father is clear in the film.
p841
aVAs were the relationships with women that kept him unmarried, by choice, his entire life.
p842
aVLeigh\u2019s screenplay also captures Turner\u2019s artistic independence, both his stubbornness and epic vision.
p843
aVGreat accolades can be heaped on Spall\u2019s interpretation of Turner.
p844
aVDid the artist grunt, groan and speak in spurts?
p845
aVI don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care.
p846
aVSpall dives deep and fascinates with his performance.
p847
aVIt took me several minutes to adjust to his dialect, but I eventually heard every word spoken by this worthy actor.
p848
aVMost of the ensemble cast checks out as well.
p849
aVDorothy Atkinson generates sympathy as Hannah Danby, Turner\u2019s devoted housekeeper.
p850
aVMarion Bailey does an admirable job as Sophia Booth, Turner\u2019s landlady and eventual lover.
p851
aVShe made Turner\u2019s seaside home a peaceful, desirable retreat.
p852
aVPaul Jesson excelled as Turner\u2019s father.
p853
aVHe and Spall played well off each other.
p854
aVThe mutual love and devotion between these two characters was realized.
p855
aVThe costumes, the sets, the cinematography transport you magnificently to Turner\u2019s era.
p856
aVI learned about art history and the human condition.
p857
aVI\u2019m inspired to know more about the artist and see his works in person, thanks to Mike Leigh, his cast and crew.
p858
aVThank you. 
p859
aV Now proclaimed as Britain\u2019s greatest artist, his talent is the soul of Mike Leigh\u2018s new film, Mr. Turner.
p860
aVComing after his other historical dramas\u2014the effervescent Topsy-Turvy, about Gilbert and Sullivan, and the dreary, bleak Vera Drake, which focuses on an abortionist in the 1950s\u2014this is perhaps his most spare, yet illuminating film to date.
p861
aVHe\u2019s certainly picked a perfect subject: Turner was a bona fide genius who never stopped experimenting or challenging convention, yet, as Leigh shows, his personal life was a mess, including unhappy illegitimate children and a rather odd housekeeper who provided à la carte services for her boss.
p862
aVThough Leigh\u2019s film follows a basic chronological approach, starting when the artist is at the height of his fame, it is arranged as a series of vignettes rather than a completely fleshed out, plot-driven movie.
p863
aVAnd for someone as complex as J.M.W.
p864
aVTurner, that is perhaps the best way to capture the dichotomy of the man.
p865
aVCoddled by his father, who runs his household, sells his paintings and even mixes the valuable pigments and colours used to create those spectacular works of art, Turner is a crude, driven man comfortable in his selfishness.
p866
aVHis world revolves around his ability to translate three-dimensional vistas into two-dimensional paintings.
p867
aVHe thinks nothing of dropping everything, and everyone, for a painting excursion.
p868
aVIt\u2019s actor Timothy Spall who brings what could have been a two-dimensional caricature to life.
p869
aVSpall immersed himself in the Dickensian world of Victorian London, even spending two years learning to paint.
p870
aVHis every twitch, lumpen step and grunt\u2014dialogue is at an absolute minimum\u2014conveys more than the wordiest of scripts.
p871
aVAfter winning at Cannes, Spall is all but guaranteed to get an Oscar nomination.
p872
aVRelated reading: Brian D. Johnson\u2019s best films of 2014\u000aThe other force behind Mr. Turner who should earn an Oscar nod is Dick Pope, the movie\u2019s cinematographer, who turned film into a work that would rival any Turner painting.
p873
aVFrom the very first scene in the Dutch countryside, to the last of the dying artist, the lush visuals\u2014especially its raw landscapes and delicately gorgeous sunrises and sunsets\u2014celebrate the artist.
p874
aVTurner lived in a time of deprivation and enormous wealth, an era when constant work and graft was the only way the son of a barber could rise to be one of the art world\u2019s greats.
p875
aVYet, for all his achievements and financial security, the unpolished, slovenly genius constantly chafed against convention.
p876
aVThe scenes of Turner sizing up his competition, including John Constable, at the Royal Academy, are deliciously subversive.
p877
aVIronically, as his works become less recognizable and more and more evocative\u2014Rain, Steam and Speed: The Great Western Railway breathes the disruptive fury and power of the new-fangled trains\u2014his personal life became more pedestrian, even happy.
p878
aVHe settled down with a widow, Sophia Booth, who fussed over Turner with the same un-awed affection of his father.
p879
aVEven after his death, Turner was anything but normal: He gave most of his fortune away, and donated his collection of his own, best works to the nation.
p880
aVEven today, his namesakes\u2014the Turner Prize, for example\u2014conjures up images of innovation and experimentation.
p881
aVAs the Guardian stated, "If the sun is God, as Turner is supposed to have said, this incandescent painter was the sun\u2019s high priest and art is indebted to him."

aV \u000a\u000a\u000aWith acting that goes from passable to laughable, dialogue cheesier than feta fondue, and a story that\u2019s as silly as ever, this fifth Step Up isn\u2019t going to win over naysayers.
p885
aVTo the plot\u2019s credit, it does twist the typical \u2018dance tournament\u2019 storyline slightly but it\u2019s not going to cause epiphanies, and neither will the tacky romance between Miami Heat\u2019s Sean and The Street\u2019s Andie.
p886
aVIronically, the brief love plot between the Robot Guy and Robot Girl has more heart.
p887
aVHowever, as with martial arts films, dance flicks are ultimately valued for their choreography and complementary camera work.
p888
aVWhile Miami Heat went bonkers with its set pieces, it didn\u2019t present them as effectively as Step Up 3D.
p889
aVThankfully, All In reverts back to the latter with its sparsely-edited, smoothly-shot sequences that clearly show the dancers at the top of their game (including Kiwi girl Parris Goebel).
p890
aVIt\u2019s also some of the best live-action 3D you\u2019ll see in a cinema.
p891
aVThe three acts each have their one big dance battle that continually ups the ante, from an awesomely implausible \u2018impromptu\u2019 showdown in a bar to a more traditional \u2013 but even more impressive \u2013 mid-movie dance battle set in a boxing ring.
p892
aVWhen the climax hits, All In lives up to its title, piling up characters from the Step Up universe for a mountainous finale.
p893
aVStep Up isn\u2019t high art, but it is the Fast & Furious of dance flicks, and All In makes breakdancing as entertaining to watch as any highway car chase.

aVIt\u2019s clear that Jones may not be able to give Keller what he needs to know, even if he so desired.
p900
aVMeantime, a police detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is pouring his heart into the investigation with only limited success.
p901
aVThe investigator and Dover battle over how involved Dover should be in the hunt for his missing daughter.
p902
aV"Prisoners" is a complex story well told.
p903
aVIt\u2019s gritty, violent and even nauseating at times.
p904
aVIt asks the tough questions and the answers don\u2019t necessarily add up to happily ever after.
p905
aVThe torture scenes are difficult to watch.
p906
aVThe performances are strong.
p907
aVAnd, the ending is as intense as it obscure.
p908
aV"Prisoners" was originally rated "NC-17\u2033 by the MPAA.
p909
aVIt was trimmed to an "R" rating, but let\u2019s say it\u2019s still a "hard" "R."  Plenty of seat squirming ahead.
p910
aVThe Blu-ray combo pack contains a couple of featurettes, but not much else.
p911
aVI would have included the original cut of the film.
p912
aVWould have been interesting to compare the two.
p913
aVBottom line:  Intense drama that wrestles with moral issues.
p914
aVNicely written and acted.
p915
aVGenuine suspense.  
p916
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aPrisoners is a pulpy crime thriller elevated to event film status by top-notch filmmakers.
p917
aVIt outstays its welcome by a good half hour but still proves compelling, thanks in part to subject matter that practically demands emotional investment from an audience: children in peril.
p918
aVA lot of attention will go to Jackman\u2019s turn as a survivalist dad driven to extremes to find his abducted daughter, and to his credit he gives it his all.
p919
aVBut it\u2019s Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance as Detective Loki that feels the most lived in (although he does overdo it with a certain nervous twitch), and it\u2019s with him that our sympathies ultimately lie.
p920
aVThe central mystery that drives the movie ends up being a bit silly, stitched together from similar films that suggest every small American town houses at least one raving loony.
p921
aVA few of the more left-field plot turns remain puzzling once all has been revealed.
p922
aVBut director Denis Villeneuve keeps the focus on the aftermath of the abductions, wallowing in the panic and grief and giving Jackman a chance to flex his acting muscles.
p923
aVWith subject matter this dreary, Prisoners can be a bit of a slog at times.
p924
aVVilleneuve has a point to make about people being capable of terrible things when pushed to extremes, and he makes it very bluntly, only to drop this line of thought once it\u2019s time for the big finale.
p925
aVPrisoners can\u2019t seem to decide what sort of film it wants to be, and so it ends up slightly muddled, engrossing enough in the moment but frustratingly insubstantial on reflection.
p926
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aDreamWorks\u2019 surprisingly awesome How to Train Your Dragon wrangled together colourful and imaginative creature designs, resonating themes surrounding parent-child angst and ignorance through fear, and top-class animation that made flying look so damn cool.
p927
aVThe sequel doesn\u2019t attempt to take things in a completely new direction, choosing instead to expand its world and characters with great success.
p928
aVOh, and the flying sequences still look so damn cool.
p929
aV(I got goosebumps at one point.)
p930
aVHiccup is now 20 years old, wiser and more confident while maintaining his affectionate bond with both Toothless and Astrid \u2013 playfully demonstrated early on in one of the film\u2019s most subtle and memorable scenes.
p931
aVHe\u2019s created new gadgets, new modes of flying and charted more territory, but still hasn\u2019t discovered a sense of who he is.
p932
aVThat all changes when he happens upon his estranged mother, whose long absence from society has turned her into a sort-of cool crazy cat lady \u2013 but with dragons.
p933
aVThe pair\u2019s rocky relationship feels light in comparison to the original\u2019s father-son conflict, but she\u2019s an extremely well-realised character nonetheless.
p934
aVA new threat comes in the form of Drago, a chest-thumping man mountain who looks to dominate everything by making a dragon army and shouting an awful lot.
p935
aVHe\u2019s a fairly one-note villain \u2013 conquering his fears by being fearsome is all there is to him \u2013 but it\u2019s in service of teaching its young male audience an important lesson in masculinity: trust is more powerful than control.
p936
aV Action, romance, imagination and smart writing.
p937
aVAt the center of it all is the onscreen chemistry between leads Andrew Garfield (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy. )
p938
aVWithout an adequate love story, an action film is only that, an action film.
p939
aVThe story borrows from the first installment of Sam Raimi\u2019s trilogy.
p940
aVAt least as it pertains to the offing of Parker\u2019s Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen).
p941
aVBesides that, the screenwriters, including Steve Kloves, keep it interesting and imaginative.
p942
aVNot everything is revealed at the end.
p943
aVBut, the story is strong and holds your interest, unlike most films this time of year.
p944
aVDespite that death in the family, Garfield\u2019s Parker is more energetic, excited and tougher than his predecessor, Tobey Maguire.
p945
aVHe is the spark that drives the action.
p946
aVHe\u2019s fun to watch and he seems to be having fun.
p947
aVThis Spidey is less reflective and more decisive than the version that ran before.
p948
aVDirector Marc Webb shows Hollywood how its done.
p949
aVMake a film with excellent pacing and just enough romance to bring in a larger audience.
p950
aVThis reboot is a major success and I hope the inevitable sequel will be just as good.  
p951
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aWith Bryan Singer returning to the X-Men series and the film tapping into one of the comic books\u2019 most well-regarded storylines (written and drawn by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the guys who made the X-Men cool), X-Men: Days of Future Past represents the franchise\u2019s best opportunity for something special in a while.
p952
aVThe resulting work does a pretty nifty job of tidying up the series\u2019 convoluted and contradictory chronology, and features a couple of pretty cool set-pieces, but it\u2019s not the triumph it was surely designed to be.
p953
aVDespite the ambition of the time travel story, the narrative feels narrow.
p954
aVThe epicness is stated rather that shown, and the world created consequently feels a bit small.
p955
aVThe films\u2019 treatment of the Mystique character has always veered away from the source material, but it\u2019s hard to see her centrality here as anything more than a reflection of Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s rising star.
p956
aVEvan Peters makes am impression as Quicksilver, but he checks out of the movie early on, suggesting that he was perhaps a last-minute addition.
p957
aVThe awe-inspiring set-piece focused on his super-speed abilities is the best thing in the movie, and nothing that happens afterwards lives up to it.
p958
aVX-Men: Days of Future Past veers between interesting and insipid for much of its running time.
p959
aVSinger\u2019s affection for the characters is clear, but the script is mostly sombre platitudes, and lacks the critical playfulness that Joss Whedon brought to The Avengers.
p960
aVCould\u2019ve been much worse though.
p961
aV It\u2019s a symphony of superbly coordinated action scenes that, as a whole, will appeal to the mainstream, not just the comic book crowd.
p962
aVHow do I know?
p963
aVWell, I\u2019m not particularly into the X-Men mythology.
p964
aVI barely know the difference between Rogue and Shadowcat; Beast and Colossus.
p965
aVIf I can make sense of Bryan Singer\u2019s new film, anyone can.
p966
aVSo, why is this new X-Men film so good?
p967
aVMany reasons.
p968
aVMost of all, it\u2019s the writing and direction.
p969
aVA complicated time travel story with a huge cast, including then and now versions of our multitudinous heroes, is adeptly presented in glorious 3D.
p970
aVAnd, with a minimum of confusion.
p971
aVLike I said before: It\u2019s a symphony.
p972
aV"X-Men: Days of Future Past" borrows a bit from the "Star Trek" reboot.
p973
aVBy involving time travel, some of the previous X-Men exploits are wiped clean and a younger generation of mutants are allowed to move the story forward in future sequels.
p974
aVThe year is 2023 and most of the mutants have been wiped out by flying robots called Sentinels.
p975
aVThese monstrosities absorb the individual superpowers of the mutants they encounter, thus fighting fire with fire.
p976
aVWhatever the mutants can do, the Sentinels can do better.
p977
aVAnd, they use their new skills to kill the mutants, one by one.
p978
aVMagneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), often enemies, unite in this dystopian future to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to keep Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the Sentinels inventor.
p979
aVBolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) was martyred by Mystique\u2019s bloodworks, prompting President Richard Nixon\u2019s approval of the Sentinels program.
p980
aVHow do you stop Mystique?
p981
aVMagneto and Xavier decide to send Wolverine back to 1973, using the time travel powers of Shadowcat (Ellen Page).
p982
aVHow do you tell such a complicated story stocked with so many characters without having the audience go crazy trying to keep up?
p983
aVGet the guy who\u2019s done it before many times, Bryan Singer.
p984
aVNot only is he a veteran of previous X-Men films, he knows how to handle complex plots (The Usual Suspects).
p985
aVOf course, a director is only good as his writer.
p986
aVAnd, Simon Kinberg gets huge kudos for making this breathtaking story jump from the page.
p987
aVFinally, the actors.
p988
aVNot only the truly talented thespians I mentioned previously.
p989
aVBut, how about a tip of the hat to James McAvoy (young Professor X) and Michael Fassbender (young Magneto) and a breakthrough performance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver.
p990
aVPeters is bright, hip and oh so likable as the mutant with the ability to run at supersonic speeds.
p991
aVOh, and a "Game of Thrones" alert.
p992
aVPeter Dinklage is interesting to watch as the chief villain, Trask.
p993
aVBut, this is the only role that could have been improved.
p994
aVIt\u2019s a bit of a one-note character, and that\u2019s not the fault of the excellent actor who plays Lord Tyrion on the popular HBO series.
p995
aV"X-Men: Days of Future Past" is one of the best films I\u2019ve seen so far in 2014.
p996
aVIt\u2019s more than just a super hero movie.
p997
aVIt\u2019s a true champion of summer fun.  
p998
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aHaving realigned the rom-com and feminised the bromance with the hilarious Bridesmaids, director Paul Feig now attempts to makeover the action-comedy with slightly more mixed success.
p999
aVFor while Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy make for an engaging mismatched pair to rival Riggs and Murtagh and Foley and Rosewood, they\u2019re saddled with a predictable drug cartel plot that seems to needlessly stretch the running time by an extra 20 minutes.
p1000
aVThe central relationship initially also seems depressingly similar to McCarthy\u2019s earlier 2013 effort Identity Thief.
p1001
aVLuckily, after a while McCarthy\u2019s loose cannon (and her The Fighter-esque Boston family) and Bullock\u2019s by-the-book agent start to grow on you, particularly when given the chance to let loose on one another\u2019s fashion sense, hygiene and dating life.
p1002
aVBoth also get plenty of opportunities to showcase their adeptness at physical and visual gags, while a black humour approach to the action will have many cinema-goers wincing while doubled over with laughter.
p1003
aVThe Heat might lack the sheer balls-to-the-wall, gag-a-minute quality of The Other Guys or even the wacky charm of last year\u2019s 21 Jump Street remake, but it\u2019s both a reminder of Bullock\u2019s comedic talents and one of the best female comedic pairings since Tina Fey met Amy Poehler.
p1004
aV So, it\u2019s doubly disappointing that the producers went cheap and stupid on the script.
p1005
aVSandra Bullock plays her uptight FBI agent from "Miss Congeniality" and Melissa McCarthy is a slovenly Boston cop.
p1006
aVTogether, they look to take down a mysterious drug kingpin plaguing Bean town in "The Heat."
p1007
aVIt\u2019s refreshing to give us something new like a big-screen version of "Cagney and Lacey."
p1008
aVBut, when you bombard us with every cop-buddy cliché in the book, are we supposed to roll over and say it\u2019s pure genius?
p1009
aVNo, can\u2019t do it.
p1010
aVEverything\u2019s predictable.
p1011
aVBefore they even meet each other, they fight over a parking spot in front of the police station.
p1012
aVThey fight over the clothes they wear on the job.
p1013
aVThey wind up bonding and bust the bad guys, complimenting each other by the end.
p1014
aVIs it fun to see the morbidly obese McCarthy curse like a sailor nonstop for two hours?
p1015
aVNo.
p1016
aVIf writer Katie Dippold had been a bit more sparing, the verbal fireworks might have been more effective.
p1017
aVIs it fun to see Bullock NOT be able to curse for nearly two hours?
p1018
aVNo.
p1019
aVBut, we know that by the end she\u2019ll be up to speed and that\u2019s supposed to be hilarious.
p1020
aVNo, "The Heat" didn\u2019t miss a single cop-buddy cliché.
p1021
aVAll it did was place two women in the roles instead of two men.
p1022
aVKudos for doing that, but give the women something to work with.
p1023
aVYuk!  
p1024
aV The Dark Knight Rises, which opens next week, is the most hotly anticipated movie of the summer.
p1025
aVAnd yes, it lives up to the hype.
p1026
aVBut what\u2019s most astonishing is not Batman\u2019s new flying machine that zooms around skyscraper canyons, or a flirty Anne Hathaway poured into a skin-tight catsuit and stiletto boots, or a muzzled terrorist who looks like an S&M wrestler on steroids.
p1027
aVNo, the most breathtaking moment in the epic finale of the Batman trilogy is when Michael Caine weeps.
p1028
aVWhy?
p1029
aVThat would be a spoiler.
p1030
aVLet\u2019s just say the domestic bickering between Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Alfred (Caine), his paternal butler, finally comes to an emotional head.
p1031
aV"Sir Michael Caine is always going to surprise you," says writer-director Christopher Nolan, on the phone from Los Angeles.
p1032
aV"Having worked with him on five movies, I knew he was going to bring something special to that scene.
p1033
aVBut when he performed it, it was absolutely gutting.
p1034
aVWe sat there in dailies and people were just sobbing."
p1035
aVDon\u2019t be surprised to see Caine honoured at the Oscars, or to see The Dark Knight Rises vie for Best Picture.
p1036
aVSome franchises simply peter out.
p1037
aVNolan\u2019s trilogy, like the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter sagas, has an engineered momentum that builds to a monumental climax.
p1038
aVAfter Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008), "this is not another episode in a series for us," says Nolan.
p1039
aV"It\u2019s the third act in one large story."
p1040
aVIt also lands as the third act of a superhero summer, the last of three blockbusters after Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man.
p1041
aVAs an action movie with physical and emotional heft, The Dark Knight Rises would appear to be the heavyweight contender.
p1042
aVBut The Avengers vaulted past the Potter, Pirates and Transformers franchises to become the third-highest-grossing movie in history after Avatar and Titanic, reaping a worldwide box office of $1.4 billion.
p1043
aVTough act to follow\u2014even though The Dark Knight earned over $1 billion.
p1044
aVTwenty years ago, who could have predicted that Hollywood would be a comic-book kingdom?
p1045
aVBlame it on Tim Burton\u2019s Batman (1989), which spawned a breed of dark, operatic spectacles for grown-up fanboys.
p1046
aVNow every self-respecting star needs a franchise and a mask, while comic-book culture ravages the ecology of the multiplex like an invasive species.
p1047
aVBut Nolan doesn\u2019t see his work as part of the trend.
p1048
aV"We never saw our films as comic-book movies," he says.
p1049
aV"The jumping-off point for Batman Begins was to make a movie, like any other adaptation."
p1050
aVYet he realizes that Rises\u2019 anchor spot in this superhero summer will affect its fate.
p1051
aV"How it\u2019s going to do, I have no idea," says the 41-year-old British director.
p1052
aV"All I can do is make the best film I can and hope people go along for the ride."
p1053
aVThere is a lot riding on it.
p1054
aVEverything about The Dark Knight Rises seems to be an escalation of scale.
p1055
aVWith an estimated budget of $250 million, it clocks in at a mighty two hours, 44 minutes.
p1056
aVHalf the movie was filmed in the giant IMAX format, while the rest was shot on 70-mm and 35-mm film.
p1057
aVStubbornly old-school, Nolan refused to use digital video or 3D.
p1058
aVAnd he often chose bravura stunts over computer graphics\u2014from men dangling off a plane to 11,000 extras watching a football game as the field erupts with explosives.
p1059
aV"Audiences are ruthless in their demand for freshness and novelty," says Nolan.
p1060
aV"They don\u2019t want to see the same thing again and again.
p1061
aVThey need to see it done in a different way and in a different place.
p1062
aVIt\u2019s a particular challenge with a sequel because you want familiar elements."
p1063
aVAlong with Caine, they include Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman who return as Wayne\u2019s two other father figures, Commissioner Gordon and his CEO Lucius Fox, respectively.
p1064
aV("He\u2019s got a lot of fathers for an orphan," Nolan concedes.)
p1065
aVBut he has two new divas to play with: Hathaway\u2019s cat burglar Selina Kyle and philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard).
p1066
aVThe Dark Knight Rises picks up the story eight years after The Dark Knight.
p1067
aVHaving taken the fall for the death of district attorney Harvey Dent, Batman has vanished.
p1068
aVBruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, is now a bearded recluse who walks with a cane, holed up in Wayne Manor like a Gotham Howard Hughes.
p1069
aVWhen a ferocious new villain named Bane (Tom Hardy) lays siege to his financial empire, he hauls the batsuit out of storage.
p1070
aV(It\u2019s surprising how little screen time it gets\u2014first we wait for Batman\u2019s return, and later, while Wayne is imprisoned in a pit, we wait for him to rise again.)
p1071
aVScarred by a horrific injury (what comic-book villain isn\u2019t?
p1072
aV), Bane is masked by a contraption that pumps him with painkillers\u2014though its main effect is to turn his accented voice into an unearthly growl while channelling shades of Hannibal Lecter and Blue Velvet\u2019s Dennis Hopper.
p1073
aVBane\u2019s dialogue could benefit from subtitles, especially since he has to explain so much of the plot.
p1074
aVBatman\u2019s voice is distorted, too, so when they converse it\u2019s like listening to talking dogs.
p1075
aVNo matter: in the end, it all comes down to a fist fight.
p1076
aVThis time Batman is not just fighting crime, but saving his city from annihilation.
p1077
aVUnlike Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker, who picked off victims one by one for sheer sport, Bane is a terrorist on a doomsday mission, armed with a nuclear device stolen from Wayne Industries.
p1078
aV"That was an important part of giving this film the scale it needed," says Nolan.
p1079
aV"When you\u2019re just stuck in Gotham, there\u2019s a danger things start to feel a bit village-y."
p1080
aVBetween the spectre of epic terrorism and the allure of lethal women, there\u2019s more of a James Bond feel to this Batman opus than the others.
p1081
aV"But it\u2019s been there throughout," says Nolan.
p1082
aV"We\u2019ve been shamelessly plundering the Bond movies that I loved growing up.
p1083
aVIt would be more obvious if it had an English character at the head.
p1084
aVThis is a very American story."
p1085
aVEven if this Brit director has stocked it with Brit actors\u2014Bale, Caine, Oldman and Hardy.
p1086
aV"You go for the right people for the job," he says, "and they turn out to be English."
p1087
aVThe pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas.
p1088
aVAnd unlike so many comic-book movies, from Iron Man to The Avengers, Nolan\u2019s work is not a maze of jokey, postmodern asides.
p1089
aVThese are action movies freighted with dramatic and intellectual ambition.
p1090
aVHathaway\u2019s Catwoman may come on like a Bond girl, an agent of comic and erotic relief, but she has a subversive agenda.
p1091
aV"There\u2019s a storm coming," she tells Wayne.
p1092
aV"You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you\u2019re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us."
p1093
aVSound like Occupy Wall Street?
p1094
aVNolan did just that when he used 1,000 extras to film a pitched battle between cops and mercenaries in Manhattan.
p1095
aV"When we went to Wall Street to film, the Occupy movement had grown up around it and there were ridiculous reports we had chosen it for that reason.
p1096
aVBut it took a year of planning, and the scene had been written two years before that."
p1097
aVWhile 9/11 casts a long shadow over Gotham\u2019s scenes of terrorist destruction, the Occupy echoes are prescient.
p1098
aVNolan "had no way of knowing," says Bale.
p1099
aVFilming just blocks from the protest, he recalls, "I was looking at him\u2014how did you know?"
p1100
aVGotham, explains Nolan, "is a parallel world, and you wind up mirroring the concerns of the time."
p1101
aVOne concern among those who care about cinema is that it\u2019s being overrun by comic-book franchises: the masked superhero has usurped the face of the movie star as Hollywood\u2019s most powerful icon.
p1102
aVWhich Nolan doesn\u2019t dispute.
p1103
aV"We\u2019re definitely well into a phase where our actors are not willing to brand themselves as movie stars the way actors of the past did," he says.
p1104
aV"When you look at a guy like Christian, whether he\u2019s wearing a mask or not, this is one of our great actors.
p1105
aVBut he wants to be different in every film.
p1106
aVHe doesn\u2019t want the audience to go to a Christian Bale movie; he wants them to come see the character he\u2019s playing.
p1107
aVThat\u2019s true of most leading men working today.
p1108
aVThat wasn\u2019t true 20 years ago."
p1109
aVNolan and Bale say they are both done with Batman\u2014although The Dark Knight Rises ends on a note that will allow another filmmaker to pick up the franchise where they left off.
p1110
aVBut Nolan, still a force behind Hollywood\u2019s superhero hegemony, is producing next year\u2019s Superman reboot, Man of Steel.
p1111
aVThe key to comic-book material, he insists, is to treat it as "a source for movies of different types, not a genre\u2014if the comic-book movie is a genre, like the western, the audience will want something different."
p1112
aVAs for his own directing future, "I have no idea where I\u2019m going next," says Nolan.
p1113
aVDown the road, a Bond movie would not be out of the question.
p1114
aVAnd he doesn\u2019t even rule out 3D, if it\u2019s appropriate.
p1115
aV"I\u2019m all about choice," he declares.
p1116
aV"I don\u2019t like being told the way I should make a film."
p1117
aVFor one of the few filmmakers who can stand up to the studios, that may be the ultimate Hollywood superpower\u2014the ability to say no.
p1118
aV The answer continues to be "no."
p1119
aV"The Dark Knight Rises" is a magnificent way to close out an exciting trilogy.
p1120
aVAfter eight years of self-imposed exile, the caped crusader (Christian Bale) deals with an urban terrorist called Bane (Tom Hardy. )
p1121
aVBatman\u2019s alter ego, Bruce Wayne, hides away in Wayne Manor, but no longer.
p1122
aVHe emerges as well, after catching a young woman rifling his safe.
p1123
aVThe Catwoman\u2019s (Anne Hathaway) strange agenda is somehow connected to an overall master plot to bring Gotham City to its knees.
p1124
aVBane seems to have everything working to his advantage, but it\u2019s a grand mystery what he\u2019s up to.
p1125
aVThere are quite a few new characters in "The Dark Knight Rises," and that\u2019s the way Nolan likes it.
p1126
aVNolan\u2019s films are intelligent, complex and scream for repeat viewings.
p1127
aVWarner Brothers won\u2019t mind a bit.
p1128
aVJust look how the director\u2019s earlier films have fared at the box office.
p1129
aVI\u2019ve seen "Inception" at least a dozen times and could watch it again tonight without thinking twice.
p1130
aVGetting back to "The Dark Knight Rises," that\u2019s about as much description as you will find in my review.
p1131
aVGetting into the story is half the fun and I don\u2019t want to rob you of that pleasure.
p1132
aVIt\u2019s a story that demands your full attention.
p1133
aVBesides the stellar screenplay and amazing cast, you just have to MARVEL at how Nolan interweaves his characters.
p1134
aVAnd, unlike the second film, I found the last 45 minutes of "The Dark Knight Rises" to be the strongest act.
p1135
aVThe twists, the turns and the reveals are first-rate.
p1136
aVGet out there, Batfans!
p1137
aVSee it.  
p1138
aV Of course, the box office for "A Good Day to Die Hard" may tell a different story.
p1139
aVSuffice it to say that the fifth film in the series is the weakest of the bunch.
p1140
aVJohn McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Russia to help his estranged son find his way out of prison.
p1141
aVWhen he arrives, it seems Jack (Jai Courtney) doesn\u2019t need any help.
p1142
aVAn explosion at a Moscow courthouse destroys the building, killing just about everyone except, of course, Jack and his fellow inmate, a Russian whistleblower and all around rich guy (Sebastian Koch).
p1143
aVThe two escape with Bruce Willis in tow.
p1144
aVThat\u2019s about as much of the plot that I reveal here.
p1145
aVWait a minute!
p1146
aVThat\u2019s almost the entire plot.
p1147
aVThe rest of the film is a series of chases and explosions.
p1148
aVSo many, in fact, it reminds me of a monster truck rally.
p1149
aVPeople go to them, but I honestly wonder why sometimes.
p1150
aVThe special effects were impressive, but unless you have a good story to go with it, they mean nothing.
p1151
aVThe story is dumbed down to the point that you question whether the writers even know whether Chernobyl (site of that massive nuclear disaster) is in Ukraine.
p1152
aV"A Good Day to Die Hard" has a heavily armed helicopter cruising over to Chernobyl without even being challenged by the Ukrainian military.
p1153
aVNot likely, since the two countries don\u2019t actually get along.
p1154
aVThis is just a big, dumb action flick written by people who don\u2019t seem to know even the most basic information about the former Soviet Union.
p1155
aVTo quote SCTV, "May the good lord take a likin\u2019 to you and blow you up real soon."
p1156
aV All three legends bring the spice to a sub-par story.
p1157
aVBut, the total is not enough to keep this flick from stinking.
p1158
aVPacino is the just-released-from-prison Val.
p1159
aVThe guy who would rather do 28 years of hard time than give up his confederates.
p1160
aVNevertheless, a crime boss wants him dead and he\u2019s put the squeeze on Doc (Walken) to do the deed.
p1161
aVIn fact, Doc has only a few hours to complete the task or he\u2019ll also be toast.
p1162
aVVal and Doc have a couple of adventures including a randy introduction to an ED drug and some action at a local brothel.
p1163
aVOh, yes, we\u2019ve been here before.
p1164
aV"Stand Up Guys" has nothing original to offer.
p1165
aVThe pace does pick up a bit when the duo decides to become a trio by rescuing their former getaway driver (Arkin) from a local rest home.
p1166
aVWhen all three actors are together, you can almost forgive the mediocre writing, because it then becomes about three fun actors playing onscreen versions of their past characters.
p1167
aVWe love Pacino, Walken and Arkin.
p1168
aVAnd, that makes "Stand Up Guys" even harder to take.  
p1169
aV Of the weekend\u2019s four new releases reviewed here, only one qualifies as a horror movie\u2014Carrie.
p1170
aVBut there\u2019s more genuine horror in both 12 Years a Slave and A Touch of Sin than in Kimberly Pearce\u2019s post-feminist remake of Brian De Palma\u2019s classic.
p1171
aVSteve\u2019s McQueen saga of 19-century bondage and Jia Zhangke\u2019s contemporary epic of vengeance in a corrupt China are  powerful pictures that confound us with jarring images of human brutality amid natural beauty.
p1172
aVBoth will likely find a place on my year-end top 10.
p1173
aVAs for The Fifth Estate, a thriller about unchained data, the horror is only of the psychological kind.
p1174
aVBut as played by Benedict Cumberbatch, protagonist Julian Assange could give Hannibal Lecter lessons in sangfroid.
p1175
aV12 Years A Slave\u000aOf the four films, 12 Years A Slave is by far the most harrowing, and momentous.
p1176
aVThere are still more films to come in 2013, but from where we stand now, it\u2019s shaping up to be the movie of the year.
p1177
aVI haven\u2019t seen it since TIFF, but its images have not left me.
p1178
aVHere\u2019s an expanded version of what I wrote about it at the time:\u000aEven though it\u2019s based on a true story that happened before the American Civil War, 12 Years A Slave waylays us with a sense of tremendous urgency.
p1179
aVI say "us," not just "me," because I walked out of the theatre with that weight of collective sorrow you get from a good funeral.
p1180
aVLeaving the cinema in a hushed congregation.
p1181
aVAfraid to break the silence.
p1182
aVLost for words.
p1183
aVFeeling that nothing I could say or write could begin to address the injustice, horror and degraded nobility that the movie so eloquently portrays.
p1184
aVBut I was left with contradictory responses.
p1185
aVYou wonder how a movie so hard to watch can be so ripe with beauty: the narrative is gilded with lush Southern landscapes that serve as a silent witness to the cruelty.
p1186
aVYou are amazed that the movie exists, such an opulent vision of atrocity, yet appalled that its story has taken so long to reach the screen.
p1187
aVNot just this specific story, but the story of American slavery.
p1188
aVLurking in the background of so many Hollywood movies, it never been so fully represented until now.
p1189
aV12 Years A Slave is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a free black man in the North, and a skilled carpenter and fiddler, who was lured to Washington, D.C. by a pair of circus promoters in 1841, then kidnapped and sold into slavery in New Orleans.
p1190
aVAfter the cartoonish pulp of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s exhilarating revenge fantasy, Django Unchained, Steve McQueen\u2019s epic is sobering, to say the least.
p1191
aVPlayed with simmering yet titanic force by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Northup is no Django-like action hero.
p1192
aVHe is a literate, sophisticated man who struggles to defend his dignity as it is assaulted, diminished and ground into the dirt.
p1193
aVMcQueen has marshaled a strong cast.
p1194
aVBenedict Cumberbatch has a smallish role as the plantation boss who first purchases him at auction.
p1195
aVAlthough he has no compunction about separating a slave woman from her children, this patriarch\u2014who goes so far as to give Northup a violin\u2014is a relatively gentle man compared to his next owner, an alcoholic sadist named Epps (Michael Fassbender) who runs a cotton plantation.
p1196
aVYet Fassbender makes this monster utterly credible.
p1197
aVAs with Hunger and Shame,  McQueen doesn\u2019t pull any punches.
p1198
aVThere are scenes of unmitigated brutality, both a lynching and a flogging.
p1199
aVYet despite the extremity of the drama, McQueen has not crafted a black-and-white morality tale of good vs. evil.
p1200
aVIt\u2019s not relieved by the typical "triumph of the human spirit" that passes for catharsis in Hollywood.
p1201
aVIt\u2019s too troubled and complex for that, as McQueen delves into the layers of compromise and guilt slaves endured in their struggle to survive.
p1202
aVNorthup isn\u2019t just a victim.
p1203
aVHe suffers the more nuanced indignity of collaboration, as he lives by his wits, using his education, while being careful not reveal too much of it.
p1204
aVThe heart of the narrative revolves around a young female slave named Patsey, the plantation\u2019s most productive cotton-picker, who becomes the target of Epps\u2019 sexual lust.
p1205
aVLupita Nyong\u2019o\u2014a Mexican-born, Kenyan-raised graduate of Yale\u2019s film school\u2014makes her screen acting debut in this role, and her performance is a revelation.
p1206
aVThe movie\u2019s most wrenching scene is one in which she is whipped for what feels like an eternity.
p1207
aVMcQueen shoots it in a single unbroken shot, not allowing the camera, or the audience, to look away.
p1208
aVProducer Brad Pitt made the movie happen, and gave himself a modest role as the story\u2019s white knight, a Canadian carpenter who eventually comes to Northup\u2019s rescue.
p1209
aVBut freedom comes as more of a sad denouement than a salvation.
p1210
aVThe tragedy cannot be undone.
p1211
aVThis is not a Brad Pitt movie, a tale of a white guy saving a slave; he\u2019s just the story\u2019s concierge.
p1212
aVThe film belongs to Chiwetel and the remarkable ensemble that surrounds him.
p1213
aVWith McQueen, they\u2019ve created a landmark picture of devastating power.
p1214
aVCarrie\u000aChloe Moretz in 'Carrie'\u000aWhy remake Carrie?
p1215
aVGood question, given that the original movie was so potent, and that Sissy Spacek\u2019s iconic performance as Carrie was so definitive.
p1216
aVThe 1976 movie that Brian De Palma adapted from Stephen King\u2019s novel has become a landmark of sorts.
p1217
aVIt\u2019s the original Mean Girls, a cautionary tale about high-school bullying with catastrophic consequences, made decades before social-media shaming pushed the issue to the fore.
p1218
aVBut if you are going to update Carrie, Kimberly Peirce, who made the Oscar-winning Boys Don\u2019t Cry (1999), that seminal movie about persecuted sexuality, would seem an interesting choice of director.
p1219
aVYou would expect this feminist filmmaker to take a radically different approach from De Palma, who opened his movie with voyeur\u2019s paradise of frontal nudity in the girls\u2019 shower room.
p1220
aVBut Peirce\u2019s 2.0 upgrade is not as different as you\u2019d expect.
p1221
aVIt\u2019s a very literal remake of the De Palma movie with some revisionist touches.
p1222
aVFirst the differences.
p1223
aVFor those who don\u2019t want to wait all the way to the end for a blast of horror, Pearce kicks things off with a grisly childbirth scene, in which Carrie\u2019s screaming mother gives birth to her alone, and is torn between embracing this spawn of Satan or killing her with a pair of scissors.
p1224
aVThen fast-forward to high school, and things start took look more familiar\u2014though Peirce, predictably,  eliminates even a soupcon of nudity in the shower sequence.
p1225
aVShe goes through the motions of making a post-feminist, post-Internet Carrie, set in the Facebook world of contemporary youth.
p1226
aVThe director dutifully incorporates the issue of cyber-bulling\u2014in the shower scene, after Carrie reacts to her first period with bewildered screams, a cellphone camera captures her humiliation as the girl mob pelts as her with tampons.
p1227
aVThe video will go viral.
p1228
aVChloe Moretz, who cut her baby teeth as the action star of Kick-Ass, may seem an apt choice for the lead.
p1229
aVYet she faces an impossible task.
p1230
aVNo one could top Spacek\u2019s visceral yet ethereal performance, which still seems utterly real almost four decades later.
p1231
aV(I re-screened De Palma\u2019s film again this week.)
p1232
aVAnd the Moretz version of the character is cut from different cloth.
p1233
aVSpacek was a fragile, damaged creature who could see her own weirdness in the mirror.
p1234
aVShe channelled her telekinetic power as a terrifying force beyond her control, even in the end.
p1235
aVMoretz is self-possessed right from the start.
p1236
aVShe gets a kick out of her powers and works to master them, like a nascent comic-book superhero, doing levitation exercises on the furniture and orchestrating flying objects with her hands.
p1237
aVIn one of the key changes from the original script, she turns her powers on Mom before heading off to the prom and locks her in the closet.
p1238
aVShe doesn\u2019t just dodge Mom\u2019s mad Christian rants; she corrects her: "I didn\u2019t sin.
p1239
aVYou sinned!"
p1240
aVAnd in the final act, this heroic, hyper-conscious Carrie takes her vengeance much further than in the original.
p1241
aVIt\u2019s more protracted and diabolical.
p1242
aVPlus, she\u2019s armed with an arsenal of digital special effects\u2014 Kick-Ass Carrie has powers that film technology could not dream of in 1976.
p1243
aVCast as her mother, Julianne Moore takes an even more marked departure from her original character, who was over-played by Piper Laurie.
p1244
aVThough she got an Oscar nomination for her over-acting, Laurie\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t hold up\u2014her unmitigated hysteria flies way over the top, as if she\u2019s failing an audition for a Tennessee Williams play.
p1245
aVMoore seems to have over-compensated, keeping the character on a low, psychotic simmer.
p1246
aVShe\u2019s a repressed knot of self-hatred.
p1247
aVShe\u2019s also acquired a habit of abusing herself by cutting and scratching her skin\u2014some clinical mortification of the flesh.
p1248
aVTo that extent, she is less of a villain, more a victim of her own self-hatred in Peirce\u2019s feminist-lite paradigm.
p1249
aVIncidentally, the filmmakers have also upped the ante of high-school sexuality, adding a dash of teenage sex (as normal dating activity) and a pregnancy.
p1250
aVBut aside from all those tweaks, the new Carrie has been very closely cloned from the old one.
p1251
aVEntire scenes, shots and lines of dialogue are recycled from the original.
p1252
aVAnd the structure remains completely intact.
p1253
aVIt\u2019s as if Peirce and her screenwriters (Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aquirre-Sacasa) wanted to rehabilitate a classic and perform some cosmetic surgery, but were scared to mess with the bones of a story that worked so well in the first place.
p1254
aVBut by taking a safe, piecemeal approach\u2014and treating the original a sacred text rather than completely reinventing it\u2014the result at times seems weirdly anachronistic.
p1255
aVAlthough fundamentalist Christianity is alive and well in America, it\u2019s much less likely these days that a schoolgirl of Carrie\u2019s age would be ignorant of menstruation.
p1256
aVAnd although bullying is a serious problem in contemporary schools, it\u2019s also a hot-button issue.
p1257
aVThere\u2019s no apparent awareness of bullying among the characters, who seem stuck in a time warp.
p1258
aVWhich brings us back to the question, why remake the movie at all?
p1259
aVThere\u2019s a commercial rationale, of course.
p1260
aVIt\u2019s a property that can be re-packaged and resold for a young audience that hasn\u2019t seen the original.
p1261
aVThe problem is, Carrie has penetrated pop culture so deeply that even kids who haven\u2019t seen the 1976 movie are aware of it.
p1262
aVHow can can you shock people when it\u2019s impossible to spoil the ending: the blood-soaked girl in a prom dress is one of those images that\u2019s been permanently carved into the Halloween canon.
p1263
aVEven Carrie\u2019s pig\u2019s-blood humiliation does not so tragic, because we are just waiting for her to unleash her superpowers.
p1264
aVA Touch of Sin\u000aA Touch of Sin\u000aAgainst panoramic vistas, China\u2019s Jia Zhangke directs a suite of four stories splattered with vigilante gun violence, not all of it reprehensible.
p1265
aVA kind of Chinese Pulp Fiction with a political pulse, it adds up to a powerful portrait of desperate individuals driven to extremes by official corruption and runaway commercial development.
p1266
aVThey range from a mine worker (Jiang Wu) who picks up a shotgun to get even with a super-rich boss, to a sauna attendant (Jia\u2019s wife and longtime leading lady Zhao Tao) who wreaks bloody vengeance against a sexual predator.
p1267
aVAs a contemporary revision of the W?xiá genre, these ultra-violent tales of explosive retribution are set against gorgeous landscapes in various far-flung corners of China.
p1268
aVWhat\u2019s remarkable is that Jia partly based his stories on sensational real-life crimes that were well-known from the country\u2019s newspapers.
p1269
aVThey add up such a massive critique of China\u2019s new Cultural Revolution\u2014the decadence of unbridled state capitalism\u2014that it\u2019s surprising government censors have allowed the film to reach the screen.
p1270
aVFor my interview with the director, conducted during TIFF, go to: Jia Zhangke on violent redemption, censorship and Ai Wei Wei.
p1271
aVThe Fifth Estate\u000a(from left) Benedict Cumberbatch, Carice van Houten, Daniel Brühl, Moritz Bleibtreu in 'The Fifth Estate'\u000aThis breathless thriller that treats the speed of data as a matter of life and death.
p1272
aVDirected by Oscar-winning filmmaker Bill Condon (Kinsey, Dreamgirls), this propulsive drama does for Julian Assange what The Social Network did for Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg.
p1273
aVIt portrays him as a visionary who is pathologically insensitive, a genius with a cruel wit whose single-minded ambition leads him to betray his partners and his sources.
p1274
aVBut unlike Zuckerberg, who seems to have no higher goal in life that personal power, Assange comes across as a genuine revolutionary with a mission that unfolds like a sub-atomic particle accelerator.
p1275
aVHe\u2019s a cyber-hybrid of hero and villain.
p1276
aVLike his long-suffering accomplice, Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl), we can\u2019t help but get caught up in his vortex, especially when the actor is Benedict Cumberbatch, who so on fire these days you wonder if he\u2019s human.
p1277
aVLike the character, the film\u2019s narrative arc of ambition and betrayal is a construct that may be too conveniently symmetrical.
p1278
aVCritics intimate with WikiLeaks claim that it is grossly one-sided, as it\u2019s based on Domscheit-Berg\u2019s book.
p1279
aVBut the issues raised by the film are compelling\u2014especially in the frenzied WikiLeaks negotiations with the mainstream press, which is personified by a Guardian editor played by the always-sharp David Thewlis.
p1280
aV(There is, of course, nothing new about creating suspense from the largely silent and uneventful business of delivering news to a deadline\u2014the newsroom has been as exciting as the O.K.
p1281
aVCorral for as long as Hollywood has been romancing journalism.)
p1282
aVAnd to its credit, the film playfully cops to its own lack of impartiality.
p1283
aVIn an amusing post-modern coda, Assange speaks directly to the camera, questioning and ridiculing the very notion of a WikiLeaks movie.
p1284
aVFor more on The Fifth Estate, check out my recent interview with director Bill Condon.
p1285
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aDespite reports to the contrary, Steve McQueen\u2019s Oscar-bait drama is not the greatest film ever made.
p1286
aVIt may well be the greatest film ever made about slavery, but that says more about the movie world than the work itself.
p1287
aVPlaying real-life free man Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1840\u2032s Louisiana, Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a typically strong performance.
p1288
aVAs do his starry co-stars \u2013 producer/saviour Brad Pitt, slave trader Paul Giamatti, progressive plantation owner Benedict Cumberbatch, and Solomon\u2019s main tormentor, psychotic owner Michael Fassbender \u2013 who inhabit a picaresque purgatory of almost Dickensian grotesquery.
p1289
aVLike Tarantino before him, McQueen pulls no punches in the depiction and infliction of violence.
p1290
aVQuite the opposite.
p1291
aVSolomon is beaten until the whip breaks, Eliza (Adepero Oduye) wails as her children sold off.
p1292
aVMeanwhile, the scene where poor Patsey (the excellent Lupita Nyong\u2019o) is whipped almost to death by a drunk, ranting Fassbender is so horrifying it eclipses the other 130 minutes.
p1293
aVIt\u2019s an unflinching film, and extremely well made, but it\u2019s also a limited one: overlong, schematic, a touch distant.
p1294
aVSometimes it seems McQueen is only comfortable showing the nadir of human behaviour, something borne out in both Shame and Hunger.
p1295
aVAnd no matter what Solomon endures, he\u2019s never more than a noble cypher, a figure lost in the landscape.
p1296
aVThe ultimate irony is that, even with an incredible true story, a once-in-a-lifetime cast and much technical expertise at his disposal, McQueen still can\u2019t manage to make Solomon a person.
p1297
aVSurely we\u2019ve come further than that?
p1298
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aYou can\u2019t fault Disney for pitching The Lone Ranger as \u2018Pirates of the Wild West\u2019.
p1299
aVBut while you can hold a bright candle to that comparison, Gore Verbinski\u2019s ability to imitate the earnest enjoyment of its source material is what really shines through.
p1300
aVThe familiar greed, land confiscation, political corruption, and attempted genocide that come with screen depictions of American Natives vs.
p1301
aVThe White Man serve as background fodder here.
p1302
aVThe real story comes with Johnny Depp\u2019s Tonto moulding Armie Hammer\u2019s goody-two-shoes John Reid into the hero he could be \u2013 though he would have preferred his brother Dan Reid.
p1303
aVIt\u2019s all book-ended by an older Tonto retelling the adventure to a young-un \u2013 a narrative device that could have been chopped off the two-and-a-half hour running time.
p1304
aVJohnny doesn\u2019t take his Jack Sparrow shtick to new Depp-ths, but Hammer feeds off his antics far better than Orlando Bloom ever did.
p1305
aVWilliam Fichtner brings a great cob of corn to his savage outlaw Butch, Helena Bonham Carter is effectively distracting as a dolled-up professional \u2018dancer\u2019 and Tom Wilkinson does a good Tom Wilkinson impression.
p1306
aVIt\u2019s too bad that Luther\u2019s Ruth Wilson is underused as a distressed damsel involved a weird incest-in-law romantic sub-plot.
p1307
aVThe constant wackiness of The Lone Ranger seems jarring in this modern age of frowny-faced blockbusters.
p1308
aVYet the cheesy tone acts as momentum to justify the creative absurdity of its finale, a dual train chase that features all manner of stunts that lean towards the right side of ridiculous.
p1309
aVThe result is an action sequence so vastly joyous that it nudges a three-star film into four-star territory.
p1310
aV "The Lone Ranger" stars Armie Hammer as the masked vigilante and Johnny Depp as his Indian sidekick, Tonto.
p1311
aVThe film opens in 1933 at a traveling sideshow where Tonto appears as part of the attraction.
p1312
aVHe\u2019s a bit older, of course.
p1313
aVAnd, this kid dressed up as Woody in "Toy Story" asks Tonto if the legend of The Lone Ranger was true, or just a story.
p1314
aVTonto relates his adventures although his memory appears foggy at times.
p1315
aVHe\u2019s got to be over 90, maybe a hundred.
p1316
aVAnyway, John Reid (Hammer) is a prosecuting attorney determined to bring peace and justice to Texas as the transcontinental railroad is linked.
p1317
aVHe doesn\u2019t fare well after being deputized as a Texas Ranger by his brother so he can help bring an escaped killer to justice.
p1318
aVHis brother is killed, but Reid won\u2019t see red.
p1319
aVHe still believes that everyone is entitled to a fair trial.
p1320
aVHo hum!
p1321
aV"The Lone Ranger" is the story of how Reid gets his mind changed on how to dispense the law.
p1322
aVTonto and Reid find a common interest, revenge.
p1323
aVBut, they initially don\u2019t get along.
p1324
aVDepp brings his usual quirkiness to the role of Tonto.
p1325
aVHe\u2019s often amusing.
p1326
aVBut, Hammer is plain vanilla as the masked lawman.
p1327
aVHe never quite makes the role truly his.
p1328
aVAnd, his transformation to vigilante trods along without much real emotion.
p1329
aVOn the down side, the film is way too long at two and a half hours.
p1330
aVWay too violent for Disney.
p1331
aVAnd, quite anachronistic.
p1332
aVThat\u2019s a fancy word for stuff that ain\u2019t supposed to be in the film\u2019s time period.
p1333
aVAll movies suffer from this.
p1334
aVBut, you seem to take better notice when you\u2019re bored.
p1335
aV"The Lone Ranger" certainly won\u2019t revive the western genre.
p1336
aVMove along, little doggie.  
p1337
aV \u000a\u000a\u000aFilled to the brim as it was with some of the finest older British actors around, 2012\u2032s sleeper smash The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was often referred to as \u2018The Avengers for pensioners\u2019.
p1338
aVWhich I suppose would make this follow-up \u2018Age of Ultron for pensioners\u2019.
p1339
