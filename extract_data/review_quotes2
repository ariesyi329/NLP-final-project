V \u000a\u000a\u000aEyebrows were raised when Martin Scorsese\u2019s real-life drama was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Musical Or Comedy. Although the soundtrack (including covers of Goldfinger and Mrs Robinson) is excellent, and it is Scorsese\u2019s funniest film by some distance, Wolf is neither musical nor comedy, more a riotously dayglo Goodfellas. Beginning in a whir of crashing helicopters and tossed dwarves, it\u2019s a filthy, fizzy ride following the spectacular rise and predictable fall of 1980s stock market fraudster Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). But between the cameos (Matthew McConaughey, Joanna Lumley, Spike Jonze), globetrotting (London, Las Vegas, Auckland) and endless debauchery, there\u2019s a scabrous joie de vivre that\u2019s impossible to resist. One scene sees Belfort vividly miming anal sex while closing a sale with a clueless client. Another has him and his colleagues enjoying themselves on a coke-and-hooker-filled private jet. Multiply that by 180 minutes and you have some idea what you\u2019re getting into. Though brilliantly written (by Boardwalk Empire\u2018s Terence Winter), acted and directed, Wolf is dangerously overlong. This is especially galling because Belfort often speaks directly to the audience to speed the action on. Couldn\u2019t he have whizzed us through the details of his downfall the same way? The only excuse is that the material is just too juicy to cut, and everyone, from a career-best DiCaprio, to his crack-smoking sidekick Jonah Hill, to Scorsese himself is having too good a time to stop. For at least two of the three hours, you will be too. Maybe those Golden Globe guys were on to something after all.

p7

V I couldn\u2019t get that thought out of my mind while watching this visually taxing and noisy spy spoof. Certainly, there is plenty going on in this send up of the British spy genre, not all of it good. Colin Firth stars as secret agent Harry Hart, one of a select group of highly trained operatives, known collectively as Kingsman. The bureau recruits British youth to join them, when there\u2019s a rare opening caused by an agent dying in the line of duty. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) a twenty-something who dresses like rap star Eminem, is asked by Harry to try his luck at the rigorous training program. Much of the film concerns the indoctrination procedures, and I found that to be strike one. The dull preliminaries seemed to last for almost the film\u2019s length. Too much training and not enough story. Get on with it. When the story finally gets going, we learn that billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has a plan to combat global warming and it\u2019s not exactly people-friendly. Why is the master villain someone who recognizes climate change as a problem that needs to be addressed? Were the producers pushing some redneck buttons by making the bad guy a believer in earth sciences? Strike two. Before launching his plan, Valentine seeks to control the world\u2019s political leaders by inserting an explosive charge into each of their necks, meaning, step out of line, and your head will burst. Many luminaries go along with Valentine\u2019s plan, agreeing to the implants. One of those leaders is apparently President Obama (America\u2019s favorite racial target). It\u2019s possible that the actors didn\u2019t know about the director\u2019s plans to kill the Obama lookalike and his cabinet. These scenes were filmed separately. I can\u2019t see Sam Jackson going along with this, but perhaps he did. The film wasn\u2019t funny in the first place. Now, it was downright Rupert Murdochian. The very conservative Murdoch owns Fox News and 20th Century Fox, the company that released the film. What kind of political message were they sending movie audiences? The scenes in question admittedly happen very fast. Perhaps they were looking for a subliminal effect. Strike three. Now, I wasn\u2019t having a very good time to start with, so perhaps the political messages stood out more with me than your average moviegover. I found \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service\u201d to be derivative, loud and overly broad. Jackson\u2019s lisping billionaire was fun for a while, but then started to get on my nerves. Firth was downright dull. And, Egerton displayed nothing to recommend a future career in acting. Spy spoofs should be fun. What happened?

V Ben Stiller and company create more than a few warm and fuzzies. This time the fantasy premise jumps the pond to the British Museum in London. The ancient Egyptian widget that keeps the exhibits alive in America is corroding, and museum guard Larry Daley (Stiller) must find out why. The young pharaoh, Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek) tells Daley, he should consult with his father, Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley) at the London institution on what to do. Many of Daley\u2019s exhibits at the American Museum of Natural History secretly hitch a ride overseas. Making the trip: Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Jedediah (Owen Wilson), Octavius (Steve Coogan), Sacagawea (Mizuo Peck) and Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher). Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a family reunion without Ahkmenrah tagging along. Daley and his son, Nicky (Styler Gisondo replacing Jake Cherry), sneak into the British Museum after delivering a large crate carrying the American exhibits. And, of course, the entire institution springs to life thanks to the ancient widget, despite its oxidation. They even get to meet Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens), who amusingly doesn\u2019t understand that he never existed. Camelot, he is told, was just a legend. Lance is handsome, but not too smart. It doesn\u2019t register right away. This character can be taxing, but ultimately he\u2019s quite entertaining. As I said before, \u201cNight at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\u201d won\u2019t draw raves for originality. It\u2019s familiarity and sentimentality that rule the day. This was the final film for Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams. Both are greatly missed by Hollywood and the circumstances of Williams\u2019 death, in particular, make his presence more meaningful. Perhaps the story is contrived and the producers were out to make a few bucks. \u201cNight at the Museum 3\u2033 is a feel-good movie, and that counts for something. Tech credits are fine. The special effects seem a bit old-fashioned, but they work. The acting is about what you\u2019d expect in a big-budget all-star vehicle. Everyone has their moment. I particularly liked Stiller playing off himself as Daley meets Laaa, a Neanderthal who could be his doppelgänger. Some might think that the routine goes a bit too long. I found the repetition is what made it funny. If you\u2019re okay with the potty humor from the first two films, then you certainly won\u2019t mind the third. I think maybe the monkey urinating might be the most bawdy moment. And, you know kids. They love that kind of stuff. \u201cNight at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\u201d was a pleasant surprise. Nothing spectacular. But, a fun ride for the family.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aSteven Spielberg\u2019s sci-fi, monster-movie classic re-released in 3D. Read more and find movie times. Jurassic Park\u2019s once-innovative technology may have been eclipsed by more sophisticated onscreen trickery in the two decades since its release, but the film still has plenty to offer audiences as a suspenseful adventure that has stood the test of time. That\u2019s not to say the last twenty years have been particularly kind to its costumes or onscreen gadgets (\u201clook, a CD-ROM! !\u201d), or the chaos theory pop science spouted throughout by Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum in a performance that now is plain weird \u2013 or plain awesome). These aspects of the film prove vaguely snigger-inducing throughout its first act, but in a testament to Spielberg\u2019s powers \u2013 utilised here in arguably his last great adventure yarn \u2013 once the dino-doo hits the fan and giant carnivores start running amok, Jurassic Park still proves as thrilling as ever. The 3D conversion seems to have been approached with the film\u2019s mid-90s aesthetic firmly in mind. Rather than trying to drag Jurassic Park kicking and screaming into the 21st Century there\u2019s a frequent Viewmaster-like feel to the layers that have been created, some elements pulled hard into the foreground while others are banished further into the background to create an environment of great depth. It\u2019s a stylistic approach rather than a realistic one, further playing up the comic book feel established by the film\u2019s early colour palette and scale of its creatures and sets. Once the adventure really begins, the 3D further enhances the amusement park ride feeling the film induces, proving a welcome addition that\u2019s more than the usual thinly-veiled excuse to wring a few more box office dollars out of punters.

I can\u2019t imagine anyone not having seen this 1993 sci-fi thriller by Steven Spielberg. Even if you dislike this type of movie, you probably surfed by it a few times on television and maybe watched a scene or two. I happen to love this type of movie and can even remember where I was when I saw it for the first time. It\u2019s an event movie. The 3D effects are excellent. There\u2019s plenty of enhanced depth perception. And, the raptor and T-Rex sequences are stunning in 3D. There\u2019s one scene in particular where a raptor tries to snap at Laura Dern\u2019s butt, after she climbs into a ventilation system at the theme park\u2019s visitors center. \u201cJurassic Park\u201d was first released on June 11, 1993. And, it has held up over the years, a true classic. It ranks as the 20th highest-grossing film in North America. It\u2019s about $85 million short of hitting the one-billion dollar mark. I doubt if this latest theatrical release will bring that much money.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aWinning kids over with its cartoonishness, adults with its wittiness, and stoned college students with its absurdness, Sponge Out of Water is an animated Monty Python movie you can take the whole family to. With absolutely no interest in teaching morals or life lessons with a straight face, the film stays true to the essence of the Spongebob phenomenon: delivering pure laughs in every surreal, bonkers way it can. A brief description of the plot will give you a taste of the lunacy on offer: Bikini Bottom literally jump-cuts into chaos when the Krabby Patty formula goes missing. The town\u2019s only hope is Spongebob, Plankton, and a time machine made from a photo-booth and day-old nachos. That\u2019s the tip of this insanity iceberg, one that is filled with an impressive variety of jokes that span from delightfully childish visual gags to oddball one-liners (\u201cWelcome to the apocalypse; I hope you like leather\u201d). There\u2019s even a sugar-coated reference to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining. The animators have done a flawless job with the \u201cout of water\u201d leap from 2D to 3D, though it only makes up 15 minutes of the film. However, keeping human interaction to a minimum prevents it from feeling too distant from the \u2018bob world we love (an effect I call \u2018Smurfing it up\u2019). The only jokes that flop with a thud are the ones that recycle material used in the series. The biggest offender is a tame musical number where Spongebob teaches Plankton about teamwork, which is nowhere near as F.U.N. as the original song. But this is merely one of a few dud bullets coming from a movie that duel-wields machine guns loaded with gags.

V Generally speaking, I don\u2019t like them. The 2011 version of \u201cThe Thing\u201d is a bit of an exception. Nothing will ever replace the awe and horror of 1982\u2019s \u201cThe Thing\u201d by John Carpenter. The special effects were state-of-the-art in the early 1980\u2019s, making a huge impression on me at the time. The 2011 prequel has much more impressive effects, but the story had only one place to go, and that\u2019s to the beginning of 1982 story. In other words, diehard Carpenter fans know how this all must end. But, true horror afficionados can enjoy a good blood-letting all the same. This new version has decent creature effects and moderately sympathetic characters. Anyway, a team of Norwegian and American scientists discover an alien spacecraft deep in the ice of Antarctica. They also discover the remains of an alien near the ship. It\u2019s the biological aspect of this dig that fascinates them. Among the Americans is Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who warns against working too fast to examine the frozen remains. Of course, she\u2019s ignored and all hell breaks loose. Hey, she had to be ignored or this would have been nothing more than a boring science project. Instead, the creature comes alive and is really pissed off. Oh, yes. There will be blood. The creature attacks by absorbing its victims and then replicates them into something that\u2019s not quite human. Like the Carpenter film, the question becomes \u201cwho is human and who wants to make breakfast out of your brain?\u201d\u000a\u201cThe Thing\u201d is not half as good as the Carpenter film, but it has enough shocks and scares to keep you interested.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aAs a stress-inducing exercise in cinematic asphyxiation, Whiplash is this year\u2019s Gravity. Where Alfonso Cuarón\u2019s film placed an astronaut into merciless space, writer-director Damien Chazelle chucks 19-year-old jazz drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) into the merciless grasp of a brutal music instructor (JK Simmons). And just like Gravity, Whiplash is bound for Oscars. Teller\u2019s performance transcends his previous roles, infusing Andrew with natural innocence slowly warped by a necessary arrogance as he seeks to \u201cbe the best\u201d. This passion drives him, but also traps him in the torturous tutelage of Fletcher, played by the brilliantly frightening Simmons. Andrew wants to please Fletcher, but Fletcher keeps the bar drastically out of reach by implementing physical and psychological cruelty that is not only sickening, it\u2019s calculated \u2013 a method he\u2019s refined to an abusive art-form. The tension comes from how far Andrew is willing to stretch himself to get to that impossible bar, and whether or not he\u2019ll snap in the process. Adding elements of claustrophobia to Fletcher\u2019s fearful classroom, Chazelle confines his shots to confronting close-ups and superb macro-photography of sweat-covered cymbals and Andrew\u2019s bleeding hands. Outside of practice, the filmmaking simplifies, creating a contrasting sense of ease. A rigid subset of audiences may not accept the plausibility of the scenarios (again, like Gravity), but those who submit to the film will be treated to a masterful finale that stills the lungs and silences the mind. At its last beat of the drum, Whiplash allows you to exhale, only to force you into another quandary: do you applaud in admiration or quiver in horror?

V \u201cA Most Violent Year\u201d crackles with good acting, but fizzles from its slow pacing. Most of all, it reminds you of better films from the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s. Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain are the husband-and-wife owners of a small, but growing, fuel oil business in New York City, 1981. It\u2019s explained that 1981 was one of the most violent years in the city\u2019s history. And, a growing source of tension is the highly competitive fuel oil business. Despite the seemingly endless hijackings of his vehicles, Abel Morales (Isaac) is determined not to respond in kind. He wants peace and prosperity, but it seems like one or more of his competitors wants to drive him out of business. The financial strain and an ongoing investigation of his company by a local prosecutor adds to the pressure. Morales finds little moral support in his wife, Anna (Chastain). Her late father ran the company like the people he was in business with. Someone hits you, you hit back. Her husband\u2019s attempts to take the high ground are doubted by not only his wife, but his employees. Morales, nevertheless, attempts to persevere against the violence, decay and corruption. You would think a film entitled \u201cA Most Violent Year\u201d would bring suspense and action to its intriguing premise, but instead it stubbornly insists on slowing things down to the point that you start thinking about similar films, the Sydney Lumet classic, \u201cSerpico,\u201d for example. Isaac just can\u2019t compete with someone like Al Pacino in his prime, at least not with this dull material. And, it\u2019s not his fault. Isaac and Chastain will both get kudos for their performances and deserve it. But, overall, the journey is disappointing for the audience. We also have a stake in this. I should also mention David Oyelowo as the prosecutor and Albert Brooks as Morales\u2019 attorney and family friend have great scenes in \u201cA Most Violent Year.\u201d There\u2019s no shortage of excellent actors. Writer-director J. C. Chandor shows great promise. It\u2019s only his third feature film. \u201cAll is lost\u201d had pacing problems, but the novelty of Robert Redford as a distressed sailor in a disabled boat adrift hundreds of miles from any port lowered our expectations. It was an experimental film, even. Chandor can continue to sail in his own direction. There will always be an audience. But, the sluggishness of his stories will take him only so far with some of us.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aMarvel\u2019s latest gamble shows the studio is riding a wave of self-confidence across mountains of cash in the wake of successfully defying Hollywood common sense by hiring directors like cult favourite Shane Black (Iron Man 3) and a couple of guys best known for TV\u2019s Arrested Development and Community (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) to look after some of their most lucrative properties. They\u2019ve upped the stakes here by pairing James Gunn, director of Slither and Super \u2013 neither of which troubled box office bean counters \u2013 with some of Marvel\u2019s craziest characters in the form of Guardians of the Galaxy, and the result is an exciting thrill-ride that strikes a brilliant balance between jaw-dropping space scenes, anarchic wit and bountiful belly laughs. Coming across as perhaps the least shackled by the requirements of a typical origin story of any Marvel film to date, Guardians of the Galaxy quickly dispenses with its dramatic back story right up front, before picking up years later with Peter Quill (the wisecracking Chris Pratt) embarking on a futuristic Indiana Jones-like heist prologue that sets the visually spectacular, quip-heavy tone. From here, Gunn\u2019s universe-building proves assured, quickly rolling out all manner of crazy-coloured, CGI and prosthetic-wearing aliens free of any need to keep things grounded for simple Earthlings. By the time a raccoon and a walking tree turn up and talk to each other it\u2019s just the latest oddity to behold, and the pair become crucial elements of the film\u2019s quintet of heroes (alongside Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista), all of whom boast scene-stealing moments and the charisma to balance Pratt\u2019s star turn. While it may lack a great villain, there\u2019s so much awesomeness going on with Guardians that there\u2019s almost no room for one. I\u2019m gunning for part two.

Or, do you want everyone to come along for the ride? I asked myself those questions and more during a promotional screening of this sure-to-be late summer hit. The answers left me less than impressed. What distinguishes a great adaptation from a mediocre film is its ability to stand apart from the source material. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d relied too much on the audience already knowing the Marvel mythology. Call it, in my opinion, an unacceptable shorthand. The filmmakers substituted mindless action for a good fleshing-out of the story. \u201cGalaxy\u201d opens with the reasonably touching scene of a boy losing his mother to cancer. The kid has trouble saying goodbye to his mom on her deathbed and instead retreats to his \u201cSony Walkman\u201d mix tape of hits from the 1970\u2019s. Cut to 26 years later and the exploits of a Han Solo/Indiana Jones hybrid out to steal a mysterious orb from an alien planet. We learn very little about the central character, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). Just go with it, right? He\u2019s a righteous space dude who loves 70\u2019s music. Yeah, that\u2019s it. We also learn precious little about the other characters who unite to become the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy.\u201d A few lines of dialogue for each principal. Sorry. No time, folks. We have at least a dozen villains you need to meet. The story overflows with characters, all vying for a big onscreen moment. The cast is pretty good, actually. Pratt brings a goofball charm to his Han Solo clone. Zoe Saldana goes from the blue makeup of \u201cAvatar\u201d to the amazingly different green makeup of Gamora. Uh, okay. Dave Bautista wasn\u2019t bad as Drax the Destroyer, a space alien who only understands literal references (similar to Spock in \u201cStar Trek.\u201d) Vin Diesel (box office poison for any movie that doesn\u2019t have the word \u201cfast\u201d in the title) supplies the voice of Groot, a tree-like humanoid. Bradley Cooper provides the comic relief as Rocket, a genetically modified raccoon. The villains are such generic comic-book stereotypes, I won\u2019t even bother mentioning. On the positive side, the film has an above-average sense of humor. The talking raccoon was amusing at times, but annoying at other times. A few of the special effects shots were impressive. But, they often crowded the story. Less is more sometimes. The 3D conversion was also above average. On the negative side, why wasn\u2019t there more of an original score? I realize Quill enjoys his 70\u2019s music. And, personally, it\u2019s my favorite decade. But, it\u2019s lazy to let established pop hits of decades past to stand in for first-rate original music. Music should help tell the story. Established hit singles bring too much baggage. Despite what I might think of the finished product, \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d will be a huge box office hit. And, it will likely break August box office records. As mindless fun, it works.

V British mathematician Alan Turing was a hero decades before actor Benedict Cumberbatch was born. But, now Turing\u2019s place in history is elevated by the actor\u2019s amazing performance in \u201cThe Imitation Game.\u201d Turing is cool, because Cumberbatch is cool. The film trumpets Turing\u2019s key role in winning World War II by breaking Nazi Germany\u2019s Enigma code. Millions of lives were saved by Turing and his team of eggheads at Bletchley Park, northwest of London. Not as well served by the film was Turing\u2019s sexuality. He was criminally prosecuted for his admitted homosexuality after the war and chemically castrated, ultimately leading to his suicide. But, the film glosses over his personal preferences and plays up his engagement to Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Turing was a troubled soul, but it\u2019s like the filmmakers decided to skip that part in favor of solve, solve, solve\u2026let\u2019s solve the puzzle. Most historians note that Turing and Clarke didn\u2019t have a great love affair. It\u2019s doubtful that Turing woke up one morning, and realized he was gay. The film should have acknowledged his sexuality from the start, rather than relying on hints and whispers. Cumberbatch is NOT one of my favorites. His Sherlock Holmes on television annoys me, and so much praise has been heaped upon the actor that it makes me resent having to watch him in this or that. He\u2019s not even that good-looking, folks. And, his farts do NOT smell like roses. But, with that rant out of my system now, I must say he impresses as Turing. The role seems custom-made. His arrogant, but endearing, style makes Turing\u2019s efforts to break the code as fascinating as an original Sherlock Holmes mystery. And, despite any shortcomings with the historical accuracy, the top-notch screenplay allows Cumberbatch to nail down every last scene. It\u2019s remarkable. \u201cThe Imitation Game\u2019s\u201d supporting cast shines, particularly Charles Dance and Mark Strong. The direction by Norway\u2019s Morten Tyldum is excellent. It\u2019s his first English-language film. If you\u2019ve never seen \u201cHeadhunters,\u201d please do. Tyldum has a nice touch. I look forward to his future films.

Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights), the rookie. After an opening sequence set in Antarctica, the birds break into Fort Knox to find a vending machine with a discontinued hard-to-find snack. Never mind the gold reserves. Penguins move on their stomachs. After consuming their fill of the cheesy snacks, the quartet is kidnapped by a talking squid known as Dave. Dave despises penguins. They constantly steal the show away from his inkness, getting him kicked out of zoos all over the world. It seems Dave used to be the favorite. I don\u2019t know how that happened since penguins have always been around. What zoo was Dave at, where he was the main attraction? Dave plots to kidnap all zoo penguins and turn them into mutants as revenge for his falling into disfavor.

But with his recent releases under Happy Madison Productions, like Jack and Jill and statutory rape comedy That\u2019s My Boy, my seed of respect for the man remains unfertilised. Appropriately, Grown Ups 2 continues that arrested development. Sandler\u2019s \u2018A-squad\u2019 is a comedy file cabinet: Chris Rock tells the race jokes, David Spade gets the redneck gags, Kevin James stops the film five times to do a burp sneeze fart. The talents of Salma Hayek, Maya Rudolph and Maria Bello are ignored as the trio is relegated to \u201cAw\u2026 Honey\u2026\u201d housewife roles. The script contains some decent lines, but the leads dampen the delivery with a noticeable lack of energy. It\u2019s telling when the most charismatic comedic performance comes from Taylor Lautner, who embraces his alpha fraternity douchebag role with some recognisable effort. But the disturbing aspects of Grown Ups 2 are its mild attempts at sentimentality that seek to promote family values. While the film idolises how loved ones come first, it backs that up with Sandler\u2019s character using physical violence as the most appropriate solution in situations that can be easily talked out of. In a comedy full of poorly executed humour, it makes the entire movie valueless.

His dad, voiced by Albert Brooks, is so concerned his little tadpole will be harmed, he never lets Nemo out of his sight. This, of course, leads to resentment. Nemo strikes out on his own, gets lost and then winds up in the aquarium of an Australian dentist. The story introduces youngsters to the concept of death and rising above one\u2019s disability.

V Hollywood breathes a special kind of oxygen, and director David Cronenberg attempts to satirize the goings-on. But, his efforts to mock show business are just so much vinegar and vulgarity. Nothing funny or enlightening in this portrayal of the entertainment industry. Big problem: The film lacks a protagonist. You could argue that limousine driver Jerome Fontana (Robert Pattinson) fits the bill. But, very little of the story bounces off his character. The other roles, Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore), Agatha Weiss (Mia Wasikowska), Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack), Cristina Weiss (Olivia Williams) and Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird) are living too hard in their freaky worlds for anyone to climb into their skins. \u201cMaps to the Stars\u201d is absurdist cinema. Havana is a washed-up actress hoping to get back into the game by starring in a remake of the film that made her late mother famous. She frequently hallucinates a younger version of her mother. Agatha (Wasikowska) becomes Havana\u2019s personal assistant shortly after arriving in L.A.  Agatha knows Carrie Fisher (cameo appearance) through Twitter, and Fisher recommends her to Havana. Dr. Weiss is a celebrity psychologist who gives personal life lessons and training to Havana. Cristina, Stafford\u2019s wife, obsesses over the acting career of her son, Benjie. The teen sensation (Bird) is a horse\u2019s ass in real life. After a stint in rehab, he\u2019s now ready to resume his superstar life in a franchise film series called \u201cBad Babysitter.\u201d Everyone behaves badly. Everyone seems to be in an incestuous relationship, some are quite literally. Despite some fine performances, \u201cMaps to the Stars\u201d fails to entertain or even make sense, at times.

V He nails it. Bozeman rises above the material in \u201cGet On Up,\u201d now in its home entertainment release. You may not like the way the story is presented, but you can certainly appreciate the talent involved. The hardest working man in show business lived a complicated life, but that was no reason to make his story hard to follow. The screenplay bounces like a ping-pong ball from childhood to prison to manhood to early showbiz to late showbiz to Brown\u2019s mental problems. It makes you want to scream out for a more linear approach. There\u2019s nothing wrong with flashbacks and flash forwards. Most movies use at least a flashback or two to help tell their stories. But, \u201cGet On Up\u201d turns Brown\u2019s life into popcorn. It\u2019s like catching the kernels as they jump out of the pan. Unless you\u2019re already familiar with the singer\u2019s life, it\u2019s confusing. So many people were a part of this man\u2019s history. It deserved a better telling. So, let\u2019s cover the positive. Boseman. The guy has talent, and it\u2019s on display. He captures Brown from start to finish. From his early convictions that he could be something special to the excesses of super-stardom. Bozeman shows us the doubts, the confidence, the flamboyance, the regrets and the talent (including some amazing dance moves) that made Brown a living legend. The story doesn\u2019t give us much about Brown\u2019s political activism, although it shows him convincing the mayor of Boston that he should allow Brown\u2019s concert to go ahead shortly after the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s assassination. It also shows that very concert getting out of hand and how Brown brought things back under control. The supporting cast in \u201cGet On Up\u201d is excellent, especially a small scene with Brandon Mychal Smith as Little Richard. Now, I\u2019m ready to see Little Richard\u2019s story. Like Boseman, Smith carried the role. You may not like the way the story is presented, but \u201cGet On Up\u201d gives you insights into Brown\u2019s life.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aGet On Up is at once the most unconventional biopic I\u2019ve ever seen, and a shaggy composite of all of them. The only real difference is James Brown \u2013 but what a difference James Brown makes. Chadwick Boseman dazzles as \u201cThe Godfather of Soul\u201d in a performance more Oscar-worthy than Jamie Foxx\u2019s Ray or Will Smith\u2019s Ali. He channels both the great man and the demons that chased Brown straight onto the stage, moving deftly between showman, manipulator and lost soul. Initially Get On Up threatens to be an extended SNL send-up, with an opening scene depicting a confused latter-era Brown holding a room full of seminar attendees to ransom with a shotgun because one of them used his bathroom (a true story by all accounts). Thankfully that\u2019s followed by a more dynamic portrayal of a conflicted and gifted man, punctuated with musical set pieces that are among the best ever created for the screen. It is with the deepest sympathy then that I understand director Tate Taylor\u2019s reluctance to leave anything on the cutting room floor, but at 140 minutes a more judicious edit would have served it well. Stylistically, there are perhaps too many devices \u2013 a broken fourth wall, time-lapse photography, the introduction of chapters with titles, which are presented in a non-linear fashion. With so much going on the pacing loses its rhythm (there\u2019s no funk in the edit, ironically). As a result, a lot of what could have been great comedy dialogue falls flaccid, which is a wasted opportunity when you think of how hilarious Brown was as a public figure (see Eddie Murphy\u2019s Delirious for cliff notes). Great performances are let down by some untidy production but it\u2019s a thrilling ride nonetheless.

VGet On Up comes off like a checklist guide of how not to make a quality biopic.
p58
sg4
V That comes despite the fact that it appears to have all the right ingredients: a director with bona fides in drawing a solid film from society\u2019s racial past (The Help), a lead actor with the chops to handle a major transformation (Chadwick Boseman, who also played baseball\u2019s barrier-breaker Jackie Robinson in the biopic 42), and a producer who was an associate of the figure in question (Mick Jagger). It\u2019s too bad, then, that Get On Up comes off like a checklist guide of how not to make a quality biopic. Here are the lessons for future biopic makers. 1. Don\u2019t ignore the coke addiction and domestic abuse! The Godfather of Soul is a complicated figure\u2014evinced by his many, many nicknames\u2014and it was always going to be nearly impossible to take a man best known for transcending stages and capture his essence between the four sides of a big screen. He cultivated a huge number of backing musicians who went on to be prominent artists; he was a generous and largely kind-hearted man to his friends, family and children; he was a creative genius with a massive ego that was frankly well-earned, helping to birth rap music with his 1969 Funky Drummer being the most sampled beat in hip-hop; he was a racial conciliator who, in one of Get On Up\u2018s finest scenes, arguably prevented Boston from rioting in the immediate wake of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s death. But he was also a brutal tyrant to his band, who rode on a bus as he took a plane, and he fined them for their mistakes, with his points and hand gestures on stage doubling as notation of band error. He regularly used PCP and cocaine, a hard-drug problem that was only passingly alluded to in the film by a single shot of Brown rolling cocaine into a cigarette after a personal tragedy. His relationship with rap was complicated, but not more so than his positions on race: he revered senator Strom Thurmond\u2014who ran for president as a Dixiecrat, to oppose desegregation\u2013saying that he was \u201clike a grandfather.\u201d In the film, racial differences and inequality are largely reduced to punchlines. He was the Hardest Working Man in Show Business. That comes with a price\u2014but so much of the film implies that his life and career was essentially an easy coronation, when the reality was so different. Instead of showing his frustrations with a label who refused to give him any meaningful creative control in the early \u201960s, forcing him into the groundbreaking tactics of starting his own label and distribution firm, Get On Up makes it feel like it was an easy fait accompli that he was able to pull off. He had to push to get heard, push to have his unique sound succeed, and at times push away the people he cared for the most, which can help explain the wild, sad descent of his later years\u2014little of which was represented by the film. And by not doing it, the effect is similar to watching his remarkable performances on YouTube as well as the depressing, rambling, context-free interviews of his later days. Hagiography, for James Brown, actually does the man a disservice. 2. Just tell the bloody story. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as Wired\u2014the gonzo retelling of the life of John Belushi, curiously told through the perspective of Watergate newsman/Belushi biographer Bob Woodward\u2014but Get On Up frames its story by starting with an inexplicable opening scene of him brandishing a shotgun in an office (details largely fictionalized); Boseman\u2019s Brown even breaks the fourth wall at least three times, which is so rarely a good decision. Its back-and-forth travels through all but the last decade of Brown\u2019s life might have worked if it showed something more profound about the machinations of the man. Instead it highlights the movie\u2019s lack of thesis. There is, for instance, a moving scene near the end featuring Brown\u2019s mother, who abandoned him when he was young, but it comes so abruptly that it takes a minute to realize what it is you\u2019re even seeing. And in one of the final scenes, Boseman\u2019s Brown heads for a stage while thinking out loud, \u201cI paid the cost to be the boss,\u201d a classic Brownism. But in the movie, he has paid no cost at all. The better approach: Narrow the focus to hone into one aspect, or a few major moments, of the person\u2019s life. Lincoln, for instance, eschews the retelling of the president\u2019s rise, opting instead to reflect his character through the single storyline of the congressional fight to end slavery. 3. Don\u2019t fall in love with your own star. It may be the biggest saving grace of Get On Up: the fact that Boseman is a more than capable Brown imitator, embodying his tics, his growl, his bouffant hair, that regal chin, his assuredness in his body\u2019s electric motions, his supreme swagger. Without that\u2014and some excellent performances by Nelsan Ellis and Viola Davis, the film would be nearly joyless. But in a way, that\u2019s also its downfall\u2014the film is so clearly in awe of Boseman\u2019s performance that it relies on them at the expense of everything else. It\u2019s an easy mistake to make in a biopic. Consider Jamie Foxx\u2019s role in Ray, Will Smith\u2019s portrayal of Muhammad Ali, or Ben Kingsley\u2019s embodiment of Mahatma Gandhi: modern biopics tend to build out from how well the lead can emulate the title figure, and work from there. It\u2019s usually a good thing (unless they fail: see Colin Farrell in Alexander). But here it just masks the weakness of the underlying film\u2014as Meryl Streep\u2019s Margaret Thatcher did in The Iron Lady. 4. You can\u2019t be everything to everyone\u000aIf Get On Up was made for people who had a serious grounding in funk music, it would mean something that we were seeing portrayals of Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker, who the film largely depicted as self-centred. And if it was, it might not need this end title card that comes up at the film\u2019s conclusion: \u201cJames Brown was considered one of the most popular artists of all time.\u201d Anyone with zero knowledge of James Brown leaves the film without a meaningful sense of just how hard Brown really worked, just how hard it was for Brown to wrest creative control, just how low things got before his late-life renaissance, and just how deeply Brown\u2019s influence is still felt today on pop culture, in the disco, funk and rap genres he helped birth as well as on modern performers\u2019 stagecraft. 5. Don\u2019t put yourself in it, for god\u2019s sake\u000aIt\u2019s always a good idea to have someone who knows the figure to make sure that the facts are mostly right, and the narrative is true to itself. To Mick Jagger\u2019s credit, this film wouldn\u2019t have happened if it wasn\u2019t for his ability to clear the rights, and his experiences playing with and being inspired by Brown come from some authority. But Jagger wasn\u2019t really all that close with Brown. Take his fondest memory from the last time he saw Brown live, from an interview with the Huffington Post: \u201cI saw him at a show in Cleveland. I can\u2019t remember when, but we were both there together. I went to see his show, and he came to see me. We had a good time.\u201d Moving stuff. Nevertheless, there\u2019s a scene in the already-lengthy Get On Up where an actor playing young Jagger nods knowingly at Brown. \u201cI want it to be true to him,\u201d Jagger told USA Today about the film. In this, he certainly failed.

V Movies great and small for wildly different demographics. But Toy Story 3 and Winter\u2019s Bone  are both tales of characters terrified of losing their home. In Toy Story 3, a band of played-out toys are driven out of the house as \u201ctheir\u201d child heads off to college, and trapped in a daycare gulag. In Winter\u2019s Bone an intrepid teenage girl trying to save the family house from being sold off plunges into an Ozark mountain underworld in search of her bail-jumping dad. Both movies are worth seeing. Toy Story 3 is a solid sequel to a trusty franchise\u2014a 3D  ride to the dark side of toyland, buffered by sentiment. With enough wit to amuse the parents and enough adventure to captivate the kids. It\u2019s had a lot of attention already. So I\u2019m going to reverse the usual protocol and lead with the little movie, Winter\u2019s Bone (which opens in Toronto today, and expands to Vancouver and Montreal next week)  This Sundance award-winner is a superbly acted, beautifully wrought film. Chances are it will be a contender for my Top 10 list by the time winter comes around. Talk about counter-programming. The farthest thing you could imagine from the bright summer midway of Iron Men and A-Team hijinks and Karate Kids, Winter\u2019s Bone is an austere, harrowing suspense story of a hard-headed girl who ventures into an Ozark heart of darkness, a backwoods hell of crystal meth and family menace and unforgiving cruelty. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a powerful, unwavering performance as 17-year-old Ree Dolly, who is trying to track down her father. He put up their house for a bail bond then vanished without a trace. If she can\u2019t find him, she will be homeless, along with the rest of her family. As she heads into woods to question friends and relatives, she runs up against an outlaw code of silence and risks her life with each step that takes her closer to the truth behind her dad\u2019s disappearance. She confronts her ruthless addict uncle, the incongruously nicknamed Teardrop (John Hawkes), and passes through a declension of ever darkening characters. The movie\u2019s desaturated palette is expertly controlled. This is a gray world and we don\u2019t see a glimmer of sun in the sky, or a smile from our resilient heroine, until close to the end. Based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, the film is set and shot in the mountains of southern Missouri, a world that is captured with stunning authenticity. I was reminded of Canadian director Jennifer Baichwal\u2019s fine documentary, The True Meaning of Pictures: Shelby Adams\u2019 Appalachia. This film portrays mountain culture with the same photographic richness,  avoiding the hillbilly stereotypes, while etching Gothic character portraits of scary potency. And the stark dialogue has an archaic, almost biblical cadence. Director and co-writer Debra Granik, who shot the film in real Ozark family homes, worried about playing into the stereotypes. \u201cMoonshine and meth,\u201d she says, \u201care gasoline on the bonfire of cliches depicting mountain culture. Thirty-five years after Deliverance, even a banjo can still be a loaded symbol. But in our trips down to southern Missouri, banjos kept popping up in the most mysterious and alluring ways. Ultimately the banjo found its way into the film, offering notes of hope and perseverance. I came to think of it as a fresh start for that image.\u201d\u000aAs for Toy Story 3, it does not depart from the safe formula of the previous installments. Don\u2019t expect anything as ingenious as Ratatouille or Up. But the formula works. A few brief observations culled from my recent article on sequels and remakes in the magazine:\u000aEach movie in Disney-Pixar\u2019s Toy Story franchise conforms to a strict narrative template: led by Woody (Tom Hanks), the vintage cowboy doll, a clan of animated toys get separated from their beloved master, Andy, and have to fight their way home. In Toy Story 2, the enemy was a venal collector. In Toy Story 3, Andy is off to college and his toys are once again playing dodgeball with oblivion. Will it be the attic? A yard sale? No, they\u2019re donated to a daycare centre\u2014a prison camp ruled with an iron paw by a strawberry-scented stuffed bear. While the franchise\u2019s sentimental mould is inviolable, this sequel has a darker, more satirical edge. Some of the Orwellian daycare toys are quite scary, like the mad-eyed, cymbal-crashing monkey on surveillance duty, or the big, blank-eyed baby doll. And in an apocalyptic set piece, the toys are sent on a harrowing flume ride through trash shredders to landfill hell. I\u2019m not giving anything away by saying that this Toy Story, like the others, ends happily. Some things will never change.

V \u201cBoyhood\u201d is the story of a single-parent family, a mother and her two children, made over a 12-year period using the same actors and director. Amazing concept. And, even more amazing that Richard Linklater pulled it off. The Houston filmmaker assembled his cast and crew annually for twelve years to tell the story of a boy growing up in Texas. It begins with the child in first grade and ends with him making new friends in college. In fact, the last few spoken words of this film I will remember for the rest of my life. The cinematic journey is rewarding and markedly profound. As you might expect, \u201cBoyhood\u201d drops in on its characters annually. In 2002, six-year-old Mason Evans, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) overhears his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) arguing with her boyfriend about improving her life. She takes Mason and his older sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston so she can finish college, get a higher-paying  job and make a better living for her family. The next year Mason\u2019s biological father (Ethan Hawke) drops into their lives after returning to Texas from Alaska. Mason Sr. also has some growing up to do. And, that\u2019s one of the things you like about \u201cBoyhood,\u201d it isn\u2019t just about the boy. All of the characters created by Linklater progress, some faster than others, over the 12-year span. Olivia repeatedly fails in relationships, but she\u2019s learning. Mason\u2019s father matures right in front of your eyes and becomes more responsible. Samantha has a rebellious nature, at times, but is always moving forward. These people may not be exactly like your own family, but you know them nevertheless. The emotions feel very real. Patricia Arquette plays Olivia Evans in \u201cBoyhood,\u201d the story of young man growing up in Texas. On the negative side, Linklater\u2019s film often lacks focus. The scripts were written year-by-year. Very little was determined from the start, just some character traits and the film\u2019s impressive last scene. At times, you feel like you\u2019re on a casual stroll through these people\u2019s lives. The authenticity gets mundane at times. The film\u2019s 2:45 runtime is another negative tick. The mind begins to wander at times. The annual segments needed trimming. Where? How much? If I knew for sure, I would be making films, not commenting on them. The performances are nicely understated. Coltrane\u2019s laid back acting style contributed greatly to the film\u2019s truthfulness. Arquette\u2019s naturalistic approach gave the movie its heart and soul. She repeatedly fails in her personal relationships, but not with her children. They survive because of her soul-searching and good intentions. Overall, a great ensemble. Finally, is \u201cBoyhood\u201d one of the best films of 2014? Certainly, it\u2019s a great film. And, many critics have it at the very top of their lists. Personally, I like Richard Linklater so much that I hope he hasn\u2019t peaked. Maybe \u201cBoyhood\u201d is just a warm-up for something even more remarkable. Something that can be made in considerably less time,  of course.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aBoyhood is a staggering cinematic achievement, all the more so in how readily you\u2019ll lose yourself in this broadly sketched tale of a life rather than pick apart how it has been uniquely assembled. For twelve years Richard Linklater has been shooting episodically, striking gold all over the place in the process \u2013 most notably in the form of Ellar Coltrane, whose lead performance as Mason is what this ambitious project hinges upon. Following Mason from childhood through adolescence, Boyhood doesn\u2019t just capture this young man\u2019s physical and personal growth, but that of the key figures that orbit him: separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke); sister (Lorelei Linklater); and first love (Zoe Graham). While Arquette\u2019s performance is a standout, Linklater conjures emotive, naturalistic performances from all his cast, so as the film works its magic and the years pass by, one can\u2019t help but be captivated by the lives unfolding onscreen. That\u2019s all the more impressive with Boyhood, for the most part, avoiding making the obvious dramatic moves we\u2019re conditioned to expect in film. One might anticipate seeing Mason\u2019s emotional highs and lows unfold in traditional fashion, but more often than not these pivotal moments take place offscreen, the audience left to ponder the ripples they leave on Mason and his family across time. That this forward momentum is conveyed more through the years\u2019 contemporary music and the physical changes of Boyhood\u2019s cast is another contributing factor to the film\u2019s unforced feeling as it moves along at a pace of its own. Linklater casts a spell that defies you to not be moved, and captures the incredible complexity, richness and emotion of every one of our unique lives in the process.

V But some films just may demand that sort of line-in-the-sand passion. Boyhood, the latest from American filmmaker Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, Bernie, School Of Rock), is one. It\u2019s a film this writer has watched, twice now, largely behind a mist of tears provoked by the film\u2019s grace notes of fuzzy adolescent nostalgia. Plenty has been made of Boyhood\u2019s production. Linklater gathered his cast for a few weeks a year over the course of more than a decade, mapping the adolescence of a Texan boy named Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) in close to real time. The boy\u2019s aging is marked as much by the acne flecking his face as by progressing pop cultural references (Dragonball Z, Harry Potter, Halo) and political movements (Bush\u2019s Fallujah invasion, the Obama-Biden ticket). Imagine Michael Apted\u2019s Up Series (documentaries that catch up with 14 British people every seven years) crossbred with Linklater\u2019s own meandering day-in-the-life surveys (Dazed and Confused, Slacker, the Before trilogy) and you begin to get a sense of the scale of the accomplishment. \u201cBecause it\u2019s such a conceptual effort,\u201d Malcolm Harris writes in the online magazine The New Inquiry, \u201cit seems almost unfair to judge Boyhood as a narrative feature.\u201d But arguing that Boyhood is something other than a conventional movie, discounting it as \u201cconceptual,\u201d glosses over what Linklater has achieved. In a film that moves without contrivance with the young man at its centre, nothing and everything happens. Characters learn lessons and grow up and go camping and shoot guns and fall in and out of love\u2014Patricia Arquette, as Mason and Samantha\u2019s upwardly mobile single mom, cycles through husbands, her desire for security drawing her to a string of abusive drunks. Linklater lets these things happen at the unhurried pace of time itself. He even lets plot threads develop in ellipses, suggesting micro-dramas in the spaces we don\u2019t see, as when a teenage Mason Jr. argues with his dad about his rightful claim to a vintage GTO, promised to him (so he argues) in a scene we never see. In films like School of Rock, Linklater has expressed a rare sensitivity to what one Boyhood character calls the \u201cvoluptuous panic\u201d of youth. Kids are free to drink beer and smoke pot and horse around without the hand of narrative repercussion slamming down. As in Bernie, Slacker and Waking Life, Boyhood empathizes with the oddballs that dot the periphery of a certain American adolescence: the Tourettic loners stalking the suburbs, the conspiracy theorists slumped in the booths of all-night diners, the Bible-thumping backwoods Texans more commonly rendered as no-dimensional caricatures. Watching these characters orbit in and out of one another\u2019s lives gives a sense of actually watching people\u2014not canned archetypes, but fully formed people\u2014get older. Time\u2019s movement over the film establishes an uncommon intimacy with its cast, a sense that we truly know them. It feels like a consummate work for Linklater, who has long been engrossed with the spaces people occupy, how they change over time\u2014whether in the all-night party of Dazed and Confused or the 18 years separating Before Sunrise from Before Midnight. He even has the indolent liquor-store clerk from Dazed reprise his role, suggesting that all his films take place in the same narrative world. This proximity is the core of Boyhood, and it\u2019s more impressive than managing a cast\u2019s schedules for 10-plus years or making nine feature films while shooting it. The gimmick becomes invisible, and Boyhood feels less conceptual than classical: form and narrative in harmony. Rare is a \ufb01lm that\u2019s so bottomless in its generosity and affection.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aRon Howard\u2019s Rush is an exuberant, diverting dramatisation of the legendary rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) over the course of the fateful Grand Prix season of 1976. Its combo of hair-raising behind-the-wheel action, heated off-track controversies and stormy relationship soap is hardly earth-shattering stuff, but Howard and writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) do squeeze sufficient dramatic tension out of the opponents\u2019 wildly different temperaments, while acknowledging their shared sense of purpose and conviction. Hunt is the blonde-and-blue-eyed Brit, a hard-partying, hot-headed playboy with raw driving talent to spare; Lauda, on the other hand, is a brusquely pragmatic Austrian who doesn\u2019t have time for social frivolities, single-mindedly focused on the race to a fault. Hemsworth and Brühl are both terrific, portraying the escalating competitive ribbing between the pair with good humour and genuine passion. Predictably, the women get sidelined: Olivia Wilde is wasted as Hunt\u2019s model girlfriend Suzy Miller, Joséphine de La Baume\u2019s role as Lauda\u2019s wife ultimately reduced a series of wordless glances, which admittedly, she does remarkably well. Technically, Howard doesn\u2019t do anything that John Frankenheimer didn\u2019t already achieve with Grand Prix back in 1966, but some of it sure is dang pretty: armed with Dogme veteran/regular Danny Boyle cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, Rush\u2019s racing sequences are gussied up with expressionistic splashes of hot, saturated colour that heighten the nerve-rattling, feverishly adrenalised view from inside the cockpit.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aSet to be Wes Anderson\u2019s highest-earning film, The Grand Budapest Hotel follows on the heels of the also successful Moonrise Kingdom in matching his now-familiar odd-bod aesthetic with a mainstream audience. But where Moonrise was awash with wistful nostalgia in its take on adolescence, romance and scouting, Anderson\u2019s latest mines its period setting in service of a broadly comical tale which enjoys frequent diversions into both black and off-colour humour even as a body count amasses and the Second World War threatens to intrude on the borders of the titular hotel\u2019s fictitious homeland. The cast list deceptively points to another sprawling ensemble effort, but despite the bountiful number of familiar faces on display and the amount of wandering in time and aspect ratio the film does, its arguably the most fixed around an individual performance of any Anderson pic since Rushmore. In a rare comic lead performance, Ralph Fiennes throws himself into a character that, thanks to Anderson\u2019s screenplay, frequently offers unexpected laughs. As Mr Gustave \u2013 hotel concierge, elderly guests\u2019 \u201ccompanion\u201d, perfume enthusiast and over-user of the word \u201cdarling\u201d \u2013 Fiennes makes full use of the character\u2019s ambiguity in class, legality, manners and sexuality, aided by whip-smart dialogue and a welcome eagerness to ham things up when required.

V From the Vietnam pyrotechnics of the school play in Rushmore, to the pup-tent puppy love of Moonrise Kingdom, Anderson gift-wraps his stories as worlds within worlds, homemade pageants of kooky artifice. And he seems blissfully immune to trends. While Hollywood doubles down on the manifest destiny of 3D, Anderson perversely flattens cinematic reality into confectionary dioramas, mille feuille layers of faux naïf make-believe. With every film, the art house becomes his dollhouse. His movies seem to take place in an alternate reality, a world that is as Andersonian as Cronenberg\u2019s is Cronenbergian. It\u2019s an acquired taste, one that I began to un-acquire somewhere between the Gotham bubble of The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and the Nemo-on-acid odyssey of The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004). By the time an all-too-prescient Owen Wilson popped up as bandaged suicide survivor in the railway escapade of The Darjeeling Limited (2007), I felt Anderson had lost his way. It\u2019s not just that the pick-up-sticks narrative was so archly contrived; it presented such a maze of tones and tangents that it was hard to get grip on the characters, or believe they were anything more than the constructs of an over-active imagination. With the exhilarating romp of The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), all of a sudden the director found his groove\u2014by making a cartoon weirdly lifelike, rather than making life weirdly cartoon-like. Then, with Moonrise Kingdom (2012), it all came together. He emerged from a career of smoke and mirrors to craft an off-kilter coming-of-age tale that was unusually grounded. Instead of building the story around adults acting like children, for once he gave us children acting like adults, juvenile eccentrics playing house on a wild frontier. And even though their elopement was acted out in a mock Godard fantasy camp, the narrative framed tender moments of precocious romance with compositions that popped like still-life tableaux. In The Grand Budapest Hotel, Anderson\u2019s eighth feature, the director invests his trademark whimsy with spectacular ambition, and the result is the most richly entertaining film of his career. It\u2019s certainly his most extravagant\u2014in the scale of its cast, its staging and its story. Composed with the cut-gem focus of Moonrise Kingdom and fired with the zany, kinetic spirit of Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel can be seen as an organic extension of his previous work. But his universe expands dramatically: the windows of this hotel are thrown wide open onto to a larger world. Saoirse Ronan in \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel\u2019\u000aThis hyper-stylized caper movie could give Baz Luhrmann a run for his money. It was inspired by Vienna\u2019s Stefan Zweig, a famous writer and dandy from the first half of the 20th century, who counted Freud among his friends, and who, according to biographer George Prochnik, wore alligator shoes, wrote with violet ink and wrote an essay about Handel that he had printed entirely on silk. In his spirit, the movie and its hero\u2014an over-cultured concierge played with breathtaking panache by Ralph Fiennes\u2014are ridiculously ornate. The Grand Budapest Hotel is, of course, not in Budapest. The story is centred in a fictional spa town in a made-up Alpine country called Zubrowka, which seems to float between a distant belle époque and the Nazi and Stalinist scourges of the 1930s. But Zubrowka also recalls any number of imaginary places of cinematic delirium, from the Marx brothers\u2019 Freedonia (Duck Soup) to Guy Maddin\u2019s Mandragora (Twilight of the Ice Nymphs). In its broad hotel corridors, there is even a glimmer of The Shining. And Anderson says he took some cues from the pre-Code comedies of the 1930s. But once again, the world he creates is uniquely his own. Willem Dafoe (left) and Adrian Brody in \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel\u2019\u000aThe story unfolds as a nested-doll narrative that spans three generations, each framed with its own aspect ratio. We run through a declension of storytellers, from the author (Tom Wilkinson) to the young writer (Jude Law) to a mysterious patron of the hotel named Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), our chief raconteur, who takes us back to the day he was recruited as a hotel lobby boy (Tony Revolori) by the flamboyant Gustave (Fiennes). What triggers the action is the sudden death of an 84-year-old dowager countess named Madame D (Tilda Swinton), one of Gustave\u2019s most cherished paramours in a harem that seems unrestricted by age or gender. The lady leaves him a priceless painting. When Gustave and his lobby boy show up to claim it, they run afoul of Madame D\u2019s son, the villainous Dimitri (Adrian Brody), and the chase is on. This madcap farce ricochets between world wars, and involves 16 characters, almost every one of them played by an A-list actor. They include Bill Murray (desk clerk), Edward Norton (police captain), Harvey Keitel (bald crime boss), Jeff Goldblum (Freud-like lawyer), Saoirse Ronan (Zero\u2019s sweetheart, with a birthmark that looks like a map of Mexico on her cheek), and Willem Dafoe in Gestapo-black leather (a Lurch-like killer with a Luger). Such a thickly populated confection could easily collapse under its weight. But Anderson choreographs the action, and the comedy, with balletic precision, while a kaleidoscopic array of scenic eye candy rolls by. The film\u2019s greatest revelation is Ralph Fiennes. Who knew that the star of The English Patient, who brought such sombre gravitas to so many period pieces, had such a light comic touch? His dialogue is a debonair as his dress, and he lets the pensées slide off his tongue with an air of wry decadence. Lines like: \u201cThere\u2019s no point doing anything in life because it\u2019s all over in the blink of an eye.\u201d Or: \u201cThere are faint glimmers of civilization in this vast slaughterhouse of what was once known as humanity.\u201d Or, even simple commands like \u201cTake your hands off my lobby boy!\u201d\u000aThis actor who once personified fascism to such chilling effect in Schindler\u2019s List, also gets to make fun of Nazis. And it\u2019s comforting to know that Nazis are once again fair game for farce.

V Oh, there\u2019s always loads of suspense in his films, but never complacency. That\u2019s what I love about his movies, and \u201cGone Girl\u201d is no exception. \u201cGone Girl\u201d is a psychological thriller based on the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the screenplay. It\u2019s the breathtaking story of a husband (Ben Affleck) who\u2019s believed responsible for the kidnapping and presumed death of his wife (Rosamund Pike). Nick Dunne (Affleck) has an abrasive personality. He can be charming when he needs to be, but always seems to be hiding a sly temperament underneath. He\u2019s not always successful disguising his true nature. His wife, Amy (Pike), is a smart and apparently upbeat woman who happily moves to Missouri with her husband, so he can be close to his dying mother. On the couple\u2019s fifth anniversary, Amy disappears from their home after an apparent struggle. Her disappearance becomes a national obsession. She was the inspiration for a series of children\u2019s books written by her father and mother. The story progresses at a speedy clip, despite the film\u2019s 2-and-a-half hour runtime. Fincher, with Flynn\u2019s help, created a complex, logical shocker that leaves you restless, but attentive. Even when you\u2019re given significant pieces of the puzzle and an overall image of it comes into view, it\u2019s anything goes until the end. There\u2019s an answer for everything as well. I can\u2019t remember a single thing that can\u2019t be adequately explained with just a little thought. And, for someone who\u2019s compulsively chained to logic, like myself, that\u2019s important. \u201cGone Girl\u201d has plenty to say about how the media plays a role in celebrated criminal cases. Missi Pyle is Ellen Abbott, a cable TV host based on HLN\u2019s Nancy Grace. And, yes, she is disgusting. It\u2019s a timely commentary on how high-profile crimes often get tried on tabloid television. Not pretty. The casting is pretty much perfect. Affleck is playing a version of himself, or at least how the public and press imagine he might be. Rosamund Pike does an admirable job with her complicated character. I\u2019m not so sure it was Oscar-worthy, but she did get the nomination. And, I\u2019m okay with that. Rest of the cast does a fine job. Tyler Perry was surprisingly aces as Nick\u2019s celebrity attorney. \u201cGone Girl\u201d is yet another awesome accomplishment by one of the best directors working today.

V There are very few likeable people in Gone Girl, David Fincher\u2019s film adaptation of Gillian Flynn\u2019s bestselling book, which may explain its critical acclaim. Bad characters are in vogue these days: not as foils to good characters or as animate morality lessons about the dangers of drugs and crime, but as protagonists who finish first, unscathed and unrepentant. From Breaking Bad to The Wolf of Wall Street to House of Cards (the first two episodes of which Fincher directed), moral ambiguity in the movies and on TV is now a mark of sophistication and depth. By these standards, then, Gone Girl is the deepest movie ever made. The film\u2019s protagonist, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), is an aloof, misogynistic hipster (he owns a bar called the Bar) who doesn\u2019t appear remotely distraught when his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary. He is irritated when he finds his front door wide open, his glass coffee table smashed in, and his wife mysteriously absent\u2014but he isn\u2019t scared; a sign in the minds of police and the media that he may be hiding something. Fincher\u2019s film begins as Flynn\u2019s book does, in Nick\u2019s irrefutably creepy voice. He wishes he could open his wife\u2019s \u201cfinely shaped head,\u201d he tells us, and extract some answers to the questions that \u201cstormcloud over every marriage. \u2018What are you thinking? Who are you? What have we done to each other?\u2019 \u201d Amy is a waifish, nagging, spoiled New Yorker, resentful of Nick for moving them from Manhattan to his sleepy Missouri hometown after the recession. We are to believe, based on a sequence of flashbacks and voiceovers reminiscent of Desperate Housewives (these are substitutes for Amy\u2019s diary entries in the book) that Nick and Amy were once in love, but even their tender moments are laced with foreboding. What makes Gone Girl, in its earlier moments, such an engaging mystery is the unreliable narration. In print and on screen, we shift back and forth between Amy and Nick\u2019s voices, equally wary of both but hopeful that their skewed versions of events will give us insight into who they are and potentially, what has become of Amy. Did Nick kill her? Or is he innocent, and simply relieved she is gone? Nick claims Amy is a demanding shrew, and Amy claims Nick is absent and angry, verging on abusive. The competing narration is evidence that marriage is a mystery unto itself, with or without a missing persons case. Unfortunately this is when Flynn, who adapted the screenplay from her book, drops the cheap, anachronistic bomb on us: Amy, it turns out, isn\u2019t merely an unreliable narrator in the same obfuscating fashion as Nick. She is an inadmissible narrator: a comically insane femme fatale whose version of events isn\u2019t sanitized to win us over, but fabricated almost in its entirety to incriminate Nick. She morphs instantly from a real person into a caricature from one of Tyler Perry\u2019s Biblical revenge allegories, a sociopath who makes false rape accusations and penetrates herself with a wine bottle in order to mimic signs of \u201cforced entry.\u201d (Ironically, Perry plays the only likeable character in Gone Girl, hot-shot defence attorney Tanner Bolt). Flynn\u2019s foray into Fatal Attraction territory has caused controversy since the book\u2019s release in 2012. Some critics accused the author, a Missouri native like her protagonist, of being anti-feminist. The limitations of film are especially unkind to Amy\u2019s character, who is \u201cstripped of her self-justification\u201d when adapted to screen, writes Amanda Dobbins in Vulture. Flynn has defended her villainous heroine by lamenting the lack of complex women characters in literature. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to acknowledge the ugly side?\u201d she writes in an essay on her website. \u201cI\u2019ve grown so weary of the spunky heroines, brave rape victims, soul-searching fashionistas that stock so many books.\u201d\u000aWell, I\u2019ve grown weary of the woman scorned. A heroine willing to set the world on fire to punish her inattentive, philandering husband is a cliché far greater and older than Eat Pray Love. Gone Girl may begin a smart and promising mystery, but it ends a misogynistic wet dream.

Ditto for Ben Affleck\u2019s casting as the often slimy, only semi-sympathetic and sometimes ill-advisedly smirking Nick Dunne, and Rosamund Pike his missing, put-upon wife Amy. With former Entertainment Weekly TV writer Flynn herself penning the screenplay and the likes of Neil Patrick Harris, Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit, Tyler Perry and Scoot McNairy popping up amongst the supporting cast, all signs pointed to a quality adaptation and Gone Girl does not disappoint. There\u2019s little room for Fincher-isms here. With a ton of story to get through, his directorial flourishes feel limited to precise, eerie lighting of scenes that are more pacey than he usually delivers \u2013 and for good reason, since Gone Girl feels like it moves along at a clip, yet still clocks in at 2 hours and 29 minutes. It\u2019s the most straight-forward film Fincher\u2019s made since Panic Room, and even that boasted the sort of showiness that\u2019s not on offer here. Instead the director seems content to let the narrative do the work, doing justice to the pulpy story by not getting himself between moviegoers and Affleck\u2019s perfectly-suited performance. Unexpectedly funny at times and happy to linger on its bloodiest moments, Gone Girl is perfectly capable of surprises (including blink-and-you\u2019d-miss-it shots of two leading men\u2019s junk) that punctuate Flynn\u2019s twisted tale with venomous glee. A totally different beast to Fincher\u2019s arguably unnecessary The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this superior thriller arrives at a time when Hollywood mostly seems to have forgotten how to make \u2018em.

I continue to have problems with the pompousness of the Capital City and the excessive sentimentality of the freedom fighters. That signals dishonesty. And, \u201cMockingjay\u201d is just loaded with spurious emotions. Part I of \u201cMockingjay\u201d is mostly about war propaganda. The rebels want to win the hearts and minds of the masses as a way to foment revolution. But, the lack of enthusiasm expressed by our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is meant to endear us to her. But, you can\u2019t BUY her emotions, damn you! She\u2019s the heavyweight hero and can\u2019t be manipulated into false emotions. I found the propaganda storyline quite absurd. And, speaking of silly, did you see Donald Sutherland? He\u2019s still \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d best walking sight gag as President of Panem. I can\u2019t help but laugh out loud, even before he speaks. How are we supposed to be afraid of someone is such a silly fop? And, basically that goes for everyone in the Capital City. Even Everdeen\u2019s true love, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutchinson), looks trifling in his new big-city duds. He\u2019s now the reluctant spokesman for Sutherland\u2019s tyrannical leader. The capital is full of peacocks, and it\u2019s difficult to believe they could be in charge of an entire nation. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman is not well-served in his final performance as Plutarch Heavensbee. He\u2019s supposed to be one of the masterminds of the revolution. Instead he comes off as the blowhard champion of all things Katniss. Isn\u2019t she amazing? Gosh, darn you! The direction by Francis Lawrence (\u201cWater for Elephants\u201d) is overcranked. It\u2019s obvious there wasn\u2019t enough material to make two films and, so, the first is relegated to being a set-up piece. From a marketing standpoint, two parts is pure magic.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aDeparting from the battle royale format of the two previous Hunger Games instalments, Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 plunges the franchise into deeper terrain. Figuratively, with the pic continuing Katniss Everdeen\u2019s trauma-fuelled mental disintegration and its subject matter becoming bleaker and more violent, as well as the literally underground setting in which much of Mockingjay\u2019s talk of revolution plays out. Against this deep bunker backdrop the cast spend a lot of time sporting unflattering jumpsuits and talking about what is to come in the next chapter, truncated storytelling that hampers this working as a standalone pic. Yes, there is plenty of narrative to work through, and the performances and events that unfold deserve the breathing space that splitting Mockingjay into two films allows. But that makes for all build-up and little payoff, lacking a blockbuster set piece finale (even as it tries to make the most of a rebellion skirmish and an aerial commando raid). Thankfully there\u2019s an emotional climax, a cliffhanger that\u2019s less deflating than that of Catching Fire and will further enthuse the audience to see Part 2 - not that they really need any assistance at this point. Director Francis Lawrence continues his knack for avoiding obvious, emotionally overwrought moments, something he\u2019s aided considerably in by Lawrence\u2019s expectedly excellent performance. The whole franchise has benefited immensely from the inner turmoil she brings to life, and no more so than here. For swathes of the film, Katniss has little to do but react to the actions of others, though she does get to blow stuff up with her bow and enjoy a literal save the cat moment.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aNever has a nearly-three-hour blockbuster enthralled me in the way that Interstellar did. After the grim seriousness and plodding pacing of his Dark Knight films, where Christopher Nolan did his damnedest to provide a real world for an utterly ridiculous character to play in, it\u2019s a relief to see him freed from such constraints. Not that there isn\u2019t solid science underpinning Interstellar\u2019s world-building (and departing), in fact there\u2019s a ton of it. Those not interested in cosmological hows and whys may find the necessary infodumps all too frequent, but where Interstellar eclipses Nolan\u2019s creativity as seen onscreen previously is in the sense of awe, wonder and spectacle he\u2019s able to conjure on this trip into the unknown. That the film veers all over the place is, to me, one of the things that justifies its length. Giving himself more of that precious resource, time, to play with (and jettisoning the expected training montage second act), Nolan gets to introduce A-list actors late, indulge in sub-plots that don\u2019t emerge until the final half hour, and take us to some truly spectacular places along the way. The cast are good, if not outright great. As with other Nolan pics, his ability to construct strong characters powered by real emotion is lacking. Luckily the likes of McConaughey, Chastain, Caine and even Hathaway (mostly) bring plenty to their performances. Perhaps this is all sounding ho hum to you. But if space travel, sci-fi and visual spectacle appeal, you can\u2019t look past this triumph of the imagination where the wondrous universe is the true star. Interstellar renders this semi-palatable for mainstream consumption thanks to co-writers Jonathan Nolan and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. Add a director who may not have the singularity of vision possessed by Kubrick (himself flawed), and you\u2019ve still got one of the most watchable self-indulgent projects in ages.

V \u201cInterstellar\u201d almost makes it. But, the science fiction adventure film has problems after take-off. \u201cInterstellar\u201d is a flawed but fascinating journey featuring plot elements that seem more Spielbergian than Nolanesque. And, an outrageously unbalanced sound design becomes a major distraction late in the film. More on that, later. A memorable sci-fi has to be more than just special effects. The story needs to equal all the razzle-dazzle. \u201cInterstellar\u201d feels like someone else\u2019s film, a Spielberg retread. The story opens with a widower (Matthew McConaughey) trying to keep his family unit functioning while the world literally crumbles into dust clouds. Earth needs food to feed its seven billion residents. And, that means family farms are of the utmost importance. Former engineer/astronaut Cooper (McConaughey) lives in a low-tech world that doesn\u2019t need space travel anymore. Technology is on the fritz. So, Cooper manages the family farm with his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and his two children, Murph and Tom. After a strange gravitational event in his daughter\u2019s bedroom, Cooper and Murph (Mackenzie Foy) hit the road to find a secret NASA operation planning an intergalactic mission. It\u2019s no surprise that Steven Spielberg was interested in this project, since it reportedly was written for him. And, the first 45 minutes is basically \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d minus the giant mound of mashed potatoes. Co-screenwriter Jonathan Nolan (Christopher\u2019s brother) likely added the family/unearthly message elements as a way to attract and/or appease Spielberg. So, when Christopher Nolan took over as director, the Spielberg elements needed to go. It\u2019s not his movie anymore. Nolan would be better served with a complete rewrite. When Cooper agrees to pilot a spaceship through a wormhole in a frantic effort to find a new habitable planet, that\u2019s when the story gets interesting. At the secret NASA operation, he meets his old professor (Michael Caine), the man with most of the answers. The crew of the Endurance includes the professor\u2019s daughter, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway). Rest of the story I will leave to you. Because, despite my complaints, I don\u2019t want to keep you from seeing this film or ruin the discovery process. Keep in mind, Nolan\u2019s worst film is better than most of the crap coming out of Hollywood these days. Nolan used IMAX cameras for much of this production, and it shows. The photography is spectacular. The special effects are awesome. So, what happened with Zimmer\u2019s score? It was overpowering in key scenes. I couldn\u2019t understand the dialogue. You could hear the characters speaking, but you could NOT comprehend what they were saying. Nolan says he planned it that way. Hard to believe, unless he\u2019s gone nuts. The acting in this space saga is quite excellent. Especially, McConaughey. He is the perfect everyman to go on this adventure. Any praise he gets for this film is well-deserved. Finally, the running time is 169 minutes. That\u2019s over three hours, folks. The story would have been better served with more specifics on why the earth was becoming uninhabitable. The takeaway from \u201cInterstellar\u201d is that Christopher Nolan is human after all. It\u2019s a trip marred by sound distortion, but still worthwhile.

V \u201cStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\u201d was poorly received by critics when it debuted, so does it fare any better with its new up-conversion? Not really. The sci-fi adventure contains so many mistakes in casting, characters and direction, it\u2019s still terribly difficult to like. The story is basically sound. But, writer-director George Lucas should have delegated the screenplay and piloting to someone more experienced and savvy. So many mistakes along the way. Since this is only a summary, and not an essay or formal review, let me short-list the major disappointments:\u000a1. Dumbing it down for small children. That includes the disaster they call Jar Jar Binks. But, also the flawed performance of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. 2. Actors being allowed to perform badly: Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Samuel L. Jackson and Lloyd all needed help from a good director. They didn\u2019t get it. 3. The writing. Dull, stilted and childish. On the positive side:\u000a1. Good performances from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Ray Park. 2. Darth Maul was truly something to get excited about. He was a product of technology and competent acting skills. 3. The fight scenes were well-executed and absorbing. 4. Tech credits are just what you would expect from George Lucas. So, how was the 3D? No better than any other film up-converted to the format. Your eyes strain to spot any differences from the original film. But, after a while you just sit back and watch it like any other film.\u000a

V Turner in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cMr. Turner.\u201d\u000aI\u2019m certainly not an expert on 19th century British painters, but I can imagine that \u201cMr. Turner\u201d is made with such care that it could be a wonderful introduction to art students studying the life of Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851). Director Mike Leigh and actor Timothy Spall have painted their own masterpiece. Turner\u2019s genius was established early in his career, and Leigh chose to focus on the latter half of the artist\u2019s life when he became even better known and more eccentric. Turner\u2019s devotion to his ailing father is clear in the film. As were the relationships with women that kept him unmarried, by choice, his entire life. Leigh\u2019s screenplay also captures Turner\u2019s artistic independence, both his stubbornness and epic vision. Great accolades can be heaped on Spall\u2019s interpretation of Turner. Did the artist grunt, groan and speak in spurts? I don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care. Spall dives deep and fascinates with his performance. It took me several minutes to adjust to his dialect, but I eventually heard every word spoken by this worthy actor. Most of the ensemble cast checks out as well. Dorothy Atkinson generates sympathy as Hannah Danby, Turner\u2019s devoted housekeeper. Marion Bailey does an admirable job as Sophia Booth, Turner\u2019s landlady and eventual lover. She made Turner\u2019s seaside home a peaceful, desirable retreat. Paul Jesson excelled as Turner\u2019s father. He and Spall played well off each other. The mutual love and devotion between these two characters was realized. The costumes, the sets, the cinematography transport you magnificently to Turner\u2019s era. I learned about art history and the human condition. I\u2019m inspired to know more about the artist and see his works in person, thanks to Mike Leigh, his cast and crew. Thank you.

p115
sg4
V Now proclaimed as Britain\u2019s greatest artist, his talent is the soul of Mike Leigh\u2018s new film, Mr. Turner. Coming after his other historical dramas\u2014the effervescent Topsy-Turvy, about Gilbert and Sullivan, and the dreary, bleak Vera Drake, which focuses on an abortionist in the 1950s\u2014this is perhaps his most spare, yet illuminating film to date. He\u2019s certainly picked a perfect subject: Turner was a bona fide genius who never stopped experimenting or challenging convention, yet, as Leigh shows, his personal life was a mess, including unhappy illegitimate children and a rather odd housekeeper who provided à la carte services for her boss. Though Leigh\u2019s film follows a basic chronological approach, starting when the artist is at the height of his fame, it is arranged as a series of vignettes rather than a completely fleshed out, plot-driven movie. And for someone as complex as J.M.W. Turner, that is perhaps the best way to capture the dichotomy of the man. Coddled by his father, who runs his household, sells his paintings and even mixes the valuable pigments and colours used to create those spectacular works of art, Turner is a crude, driven man comfortable in his selfishness. His world revolves around his ability to translate three-dimensional vistas into two-dimensional paintings. He thinks nothing of dropping everything, and everyone, for a painting excursion. It\u2019s actor Timothy Spall who brings what could have been a two-dimensional caricature to life. Spall immersed himself in the Dickensian world of Victorian London, even spending two years learning to paint. His every twitch, lumpen step and grunt\u2014dialogue is at an absolute minimum\u2014conveys more than the wordiest of scripts. After winning at Cannes, Spall is all but guaranteed to get an Oscar nomination. Related reading: Brian D. Johnson\u2019s best films of 2014\u000aThe other force behind Mr. Turner who should earn an Oscar nod is Dick Pope, the movie\u2019s cinematographer, who turned film into a work that would rival any Turner painting. From the very first scene in the Dutch countryside, to the last of the dying artist, the lush visuals\u2014especially its raw landscapes and delicately gorgeous sunrises and sunsets\u2014celebrate the artist. Turner lived in a time of deprivation and enormous wealth, an era when constant work and graft was the only way the son of a barber could rise to be one of the art world\u2019s greats. Yet, for all his achievements and financial security, the unpolished, slovenly genius constantly chafed against convention. The scenes of Turner sizing up his competition, including John Constable, at the Royal Academy, are deliciously subversive. Ironically, as his works become less recognizable and more and more evocative\u2014Rain, Steam and Speed: The Great Western Railway breathes the disruptive fury and power of the new-fangled trains\u2014his personal life became more pedestrian, even happy. He settled down with a widow, Sophia Booth, who fussed over Turner with the same un-awed affection of his father. Even after his death, Turner was anything but normal: He gave most of his fortune away, and donated his collection of his own, best works to the nation. Even today, his namesakes\u2014the Turner Prize, for example\u2014conjures up images of innovation and experimentation. As the Guardian stated, \u201cIf the sun is God, as Turner is supposed to have said, this incandescent painter was the sun\u2019s high priest and art is indebted to him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a10 shares\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse filmJ.M.W.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aWith acting that goes from passable to laughable, dialogue cheesier than feta fondue, and a story that\u2019s as silly as ever, this fifth Step Up isn\u2019t going to win over naysayers. To the plot\u2019s credit, it does twist the typical \u2018dance tournament\u2019 storyline slightly but it\u2019s not going to cause epiphanies, and neither will the tacky romance between Miami Heat\u2019s Sean and The Street\u2019s Andie. Ironically, the brief love plot between the Robot Guy and Robot Girl has more heart. However, as with martial arts films, dance flicks are ultimately valued for their choreography and complementary camera work. While Miami Heat went bonkers with its set pieces, it didn\u2019t present them as effectively as Step Up 3D. Thankfully, All In reverts back to the latter with its sparsely-edited, smoothly-shot sequences that clearly show the dancers at the top of their game (including Kiwi girl Parris Goebel). It\u2019s also some of the best live-action 3D you\u2019ll see in a cinema. The three acts each have their one big dance battle that continually ups the ante, from an awesomely implausible \u2018impromptu\u2019 showdown in a bar to a more traditional \u2013 but even more impressive \u2013 mid-movie dance battle set in a boxing ring. When the climax hits, All In lives up to its title, piling up characters from the Step Up universe for a mountainous finale. Step Up isn\u2019t high art, but it is the Fast & Furious of dance flicks, and All In makes breakdancing as entertaining to watch as any highway car chase.

V The question, as answered in \u201cPrisoners,\u201d is pretty far. Hugh Jackman stars as Keller Dover, a man who never doubts the end justifies the means. When his six year old daughter is abducted along with another girl, he kidnaps a mentally challenged man whose van was seen in his neighborhood at the time of the abduction. Alex Jones (Paul Dano) clearly knows something, but is he really responsible for the crime? Keller takes Jones to an abandoned rental property and proceeds to torture him until he gets some answers. It\u2019s clear that Jones may not be able to give Keller what he needs to know, even if he so desired. Meantime, a police detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is pouring his heart into the investigation with only limited success. The investigator and Dover battle over how involved Dover should be in the hunt for his missing daughter. \u201cPrisoners\u201d is a complex story well told. It\u2019s gritty, violent and even nauseating at times. It asks the tough questions and the answers don\u2019t necessarily add up to happily ever after. The torture scenes are difficult to watch. The performances are strong. And, the ending is as intense as it obscure. \u201cPrisoners\u201d was originally rated \u201cNC-17\u2033 by the MPAA. It was trimmed to an \u201cR\u201d rating, but let\u2019s say it\u2019s still a \u201chard\u201d \u201cR.\u201d  Plenty of seat squirming ahead. The Blu-ray combo pack contains a couple of featurettes, but not much else. I would have included the original cut of the film. Would have been interesting to compare the two.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aPrisoners is a pulpy crime thriller elevated to event film status by top-notch filmmakers. It outstays its welcome by a good half hour but still proves compelling, thanks in part to subject matter that practically demands emotional investment from an audience: children in peril. A lot of attention will go to Jackman\u2019s turn as a survivalist dad driven to extremes to find his abducted daughter, and to his credit he gives it his all. But it\u2019s Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance as Detective Loki that feels the most lived in (although he does overdo it with a certain nervous twitch), and it\u2019s with him that our sympathies ultimately lie. The central mystery that drives the movie ends up being a bit silly, stitched together from similar films that suggest every small American town houses at least one raving loony. A few of the more left-field plot turns remain puzzling once all has been revealed. But director Denis Villeneuve keeps the focus on the aftermath of the abductions, wallowing in the panic and grief and giving Jackman a chance to flex his acting muscles. With subject matter this dreary, Prisoners can be a bit of a slog at times. Villeneuve has a point to make about people being capable of terrible things when pushed to extremes, and he makes it very bluntly, only to drop this line of thought once it\u2019s time for the big finale. Prisoners can\u2019t seem to decide what sort of film it wants to be, and so it ends up slightly muddled, engrossing enough in the moment but frustratingly insubstantial on reflection.

Oh, and the flying sequences still look so damn cool. (I got goosebumps at one point.)

He\u2019s created new gadgets, new modes of flying and charted more territory, but still hasn\u2019t discovered a sense of who he is.

The pair\u2019s rocky relationship feels light in comparison to the original\u2019s father-son conflict, but she\u2019s an extremely well-realised character nonetheless. A new threat comes in the form of Drago, a chest-thumping man mountain who looks to dominate everything by making a dragon army and shouting an awful lot. He\u2019s a fairly one-note villain \u2013 conquering his fears by being fearsome is all there is to him \u2013 but it\u2019s in service of teaching its young male audience an important lesson in masculinity: trust is more powerful than control.

V Action, romance, imagination and smart writing. At the center of it all is the onscreen chemistry between leads Andrew Garfield (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy. )  Without an adequate love story, an action film is only that, an action film. The story borrows from the first installment of Sam Raimi\u2019s trilogy. At least as it pertains to the offing of Parker\u2019s Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Besides that, the screenwriters, including Steve Kloves, keep it interesting and imaginative. Not everything is revealed at the end. But, the story is strong and holds your interest, unlike most films this time of year. Despite that death in the family, Garfield\u2019s Parker is more energetic, excited and tougher than his predecessor, Tobey Maguire. He is the spark that drives the action. He\u2019s fun to watch and he seems to be having fun. This Spidey is less reflective and more decisive than the version that ran before. Director Marc Webb shows Hollywood how its done. Make a film with excellent pacing and just enough romance to bring in a larger audience. This reboot is a major success and I hope the inevitable sequel will be just as good.

Despite the ambition of the time travel story, the narrative feels narrow. The epicness is stated rather that shown, and the world created consequently feels a bit small. The films\u2019 treatment of the Mystique character has always veered away from the source material, but it\u2019s hard to see her centrality here as anything more than a reflection of Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s rising star.

V It\u2019s a symphony of superbly coordinated action scenes that, as a whole, will appeal to the mainstream, not just the comic book crowd. How do I know? Well, I\u2019m not particularly into the X-Men mythology. I barely know the difference between Rogue and Shadowcat; Beast and Colossus. If I can make sense of Bryan Singer\u2019s new film, anyone can. So, why is this new X-Men film so good? Many reasons. Most of all, it\u2019s the writing and direction. A complicated time travel story with a huge cast, including then and now versions of our multitudinous heroes, is adeptly presented in glorious 3D. And, with a minimum of confusion. Like I said before: It\u2019s a symphony. \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d borrows a bit from the \u201cStar Trek\u201d reboot. By involving time travel, some of the previous X-Men exploits are wiped clean and a younger generation of mutants are allowed to move the story forward in future sequels. The year is 2023 and most of the mutants have been wiped out by flying robots called Sentinels. These monstrosities absorb the individual superpowers of the mutants they encounter, thus fighting fire with fire. Whatever the mutants can do, the Sentinels can do better. And, they use their new skills to kill the mutants, one by one. Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), often enemies, unite in this dystopian future to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to keep Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the Sentinels inventor. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) was martyred by Mystique\u2019s bloodworks, prompting President Richard Nixon\u2019s approval of the Sentinels program. How do you stop Mystique? Magneto and Xavier decide to send Wolverine back to 1973, using the time travel powers of Shadowcat (Ellen Page). How do you tell such a complicated story stocked with so many characters without having the audience go crazy trying to keep up? Get the guy who\u2019s done it before many times, Bryan Singer. Not only is he a veteran of previous X-Men films, he knows how to handle complex plots (The Usual Suspects). Of course, a director is only good as his writer. And, Simon Kinberg gets huge kudos for making this breathtaking story jump from the page. Finally, the actors. Not only the truly talented thespians I mentioned previously. But, how about a tip of the hat to James McAvoy (young Professor X) and Michael Fassbender (young Magneto) and a breakthrough performance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver. Peters is bright, hip and oh so likable as the mutant with the ability to run at supersonic speeds. Oh, and a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d alert. Peter Dinklage is interesting to watch as the chief villain, Trask. But, this is the only role that could have been improved. It\u2019s a bit of a one-note character, and that\u2019s not the fault of the excellent actor who plays Lord Tyrion on the popular HBO series. \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d is one of the best films I\u2019ve seen so far in 2014.

For while Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy make for an engaging mismatched pair to rival Riggs and Murtagh and Foley and Rosewood, they\u2019re saddled with a predictable drug cartel plot that seems to needlessly stretch the running time by an extra 20 minutes. The central relationship initially also seems depressingly similar to McCarthy\u2019s earlier 2013 effort Identity Thief. Luckily, after a while McCarthy\u2019s loose cannon (and her The Fighter-esque Boston family) and Bullock\u2019s by-the-book agent start to grow on you, particularly when given the chance to let loose on one another\u2019s fashion sense, hygiene and dating life. Both also get plenty of opportunities to showcase their adeptness at physical and visual gags, while a black humour approach to the action will have many cinema-goers wincing while doubled over with laughter. The Heat might lack the sheer balls-to-the-wall, gag-a-minute quality of The Other Guys or even the wacky charm of last year\u2019s 21 Jump Street remake, but it\u2019s both a reminder of Bullock\u2019s comedic talents and one of the best female comedic pairings since Tina Fey met Amy Poehler.

V The Dark Knight Rises, which opens next week, is the most hotly anticipated movie of the summer. And yes, it lives up to the hype. But what\u2019s most astonishing is not Batman\u2019s new flying machine that zooms around skyscraper canyons, or a flirty Anne Hathaway poured into a skin-tight catsuit and stiletto boots, or a muzzled terrorist who looks like an S&M wrestler on steroids. No, the most breathtaking moment in the epic finale of the Batman trilogy is when Michael Caine weeps. Why? That would be a spoiler. Let\u2019s just say the domestic bickering between Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Alfred (Caine), his paternal butler, finally comes to an emotional head. \u201cSir Michael Caine is always going to surprise you,\u201d says writer-director Christopher Nolan, on the phone from Los Angeles. \u201cHaving worked with him on five movies, I knew he was going to bring something special to that scene. But when he performed it, it was absolutely gutting. We sat there in dailies and people were just sobbing.\u201d\u000aDon\u2019t be surprised to see Caine honoured at the Oscars, or to see The Dark Knight Rises vie for Best Picture. Some franchises simply peter out. Nolan\u2019s trilogy, like the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter sagas, has an engineered momentum that builds to a monumental climax. After Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008), \u201cthis is not another episode in a series for us,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cIt\u2019s the third act in one large story.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt also lands as the third act of a superhero summer, the last of three blockbusters after Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man. As an action movie with physical and emotional heft, The Dark Knight Rises would appear to be the heavyweight contender. But The Avengers vaulted past the Potter, Pirates and Transformers franchises to become the third-highest-grossing movie in history after Avatar and Titanic, reaping a worldwide box office of $1.4 billion. Tough act to follow\u2014even though The Dark Knight earned over $1 billion. Twenty years ago, who could have predicted that Hollywood would be a comic-book kingdom? Blame it on Tim Burton\u2019s Batman (1989), which spawned a breed of dark, operatic spectacles for grown-up fanboys. Now every self-respecting star needs a franchise and a mask, while comic-book culture ravages the ecology of the multiplex like an invasive species. But Nolan doesn\u2019t see his work as part of the trend. \u201cWe never saw our films as comic-book movies,\u201d he says. \u201cThe jumping-off point for Batman Begins was to make a movie, like any other adaptation.\u201d Yet he realizes that Rises\u2019 anchor spot in this superhero summer will affect its fate. \u201cHow it\u2019s going to do, I have no idea,\u201d says the 41-year-old British director. \u201cAll I can do is make the best film I can and hope people go along for the ride.\u201d\u000aThere is a lot riding on it. Everything about The Dark Knight Rises seems to be an escalation of scale. With an estimated budget of $250 million, it clocks in at a mighty two hours, 44 minutes. Half the movie was filmed in the giant IMAX format, while the rest was shot on 70-mm and 35-mm film. Stubbornly old-school, Nolan refused to use digital video or 3D. And he often chose bravura stunts over computer graphics\u2014from men dangling off a plane to 11,000 extras watching a football game as the field erupts with explosives. \u201cAudiences are ruthless in their demand for freshness and novelty,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see the same thing again and again. They need to see it done in a different way and in a different place. It\u2019s a particular challenge with a sequel because you want familiar elements.\u201d\u000aAlong with Caine, they include Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman who return as Wayne\u2019s two other father figures, Commissioner Gordon and his CEO Lucius Fox, respectively. (\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of fathers for an orphan,\u201d Nolan concedes.) But he has two new divas to play with: Hathaway\u2019s cat burglar Selina Kyle and philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard). The Dark Knight Rises picks up the story eight years after The Dark Knight. Having taken the fall for the death of district attorney Harvey Dent, Batman has vanished. Bruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, is now a bearded recluse who walks with a cane, holed up in Wayne Manor like a Gotham Howard Hughes. When a ferocious new villain named Bane (Tom Hardy) lays siege to his financial empire, he hauls the batsuit out of storage. (It\u2019s surprising how little screen time it gets\u2014first we wait for Batman\u2019s return, and later, while Wayne is imprisoned in a pit, we wait for him to rise again.) Scarred by a horrific injury (what comic-book villain isn\u2019t? ), Bane is masked by a contraption that pumps him with painkillers\u2014though its main effect is to turn his accented voice into an unearthly growl while channelling shades of Hannibal Lecter and Blue Velvet\u2019s Dennis Hopper. Bane\u2019s dialogue could benefit from subtitles, especially since he has to explain so much of the plot. Batman\u2019s voice is distorted, too, so when they converse it\u2019s like listening to talking dogs. No matter: in the end, it all comes down to a fist fight. This time Batman is not just fighting crime, but saving his city from annihilation. Unlike Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker, who picked off victims one by one for sheer sport, Bane is a terrorist on a doomsday mission, armed with a nuclear device stolen from Wayne Industries. \u201cThat was an important part of giving this film the scale it needed,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cWhen you\u2019re just stuck in Gotham, there\u2019s a danger things start to feel a bit village-y.\u201d\u000aBetween the spectre of epic terrorism and the allure of lethal women, there\u2019s more of a James Bond feel to this Batman opus than the others. \u201cBut it\u2019s been there throughout,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cWe\u2019ve been shamelessly plundering the Bond movies that I loved growing up. It would be more obvious if it had an English character at the head. This is a very American story.\u201d Even if this Brit director has stocked it with Brit actors\u2014Bale, Caine, Oldman and Hardy. \u201cYou go for the right people for the job,\u201d he says, \u201cand they turn out to be English.\u201d\u000aThe pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas. And unlike so many comic-book movies, from Iron Man to The Avengers, Nolan\u2019s work is not a maze of jokey, postmodern asides. These are action movies freighted with dramatic and intellectual ambition. Hathaway\u2019s Catwoman may come on like a Bond girl, an agent of comic and erotic relief, but she has a subversive agenda. \u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming,\u201d she tells Wayne. \u201cYou and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you\u2019re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us.\u201d\u000aSound like Occupy Wall Street? Nolan did just that when he used 1,000 extras to film a pitched battle between cops and mercenaries in Manhattan. \u201cWhen we went to Wall Street to film, the Occupy movement had grown up around it and there were ridiculous reports we had chosen it for that reason. But it took a year of planning, and the scene had been written two years before that.\u201d While 9/11 casts a long shadow over Gotham\u2019s scenes of terrorist destruction, the Occupy echoes are prescient. Nolan \u201chad no way of knowing,\u201d says Bale. Filming just blocks from the protest, he recalls, \u201cI was looking at him\u2014how did you know?\u201d Gotham, explains Nolan, \u201cis a parallel world, and you wind up mirroring the concerns of the time.\u201d\u000aOne concern among those who care about cinema is that it\u2019s being overrun by comic-book franchises: the masked superhero has usurped the face of the movie star as Hollywood\u2019s most powerful icon. Which Nolan doesn\u2019t dispute. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely well into a phase where our actors are not willing to brand themselves as movie stars the way actors of the past did,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you look at a guy like Christian, whether he\u2019s wearing a mask or not, this is one of our great actors. But he wants to be different in every film. He doesn\u2019t want the audience to go to a Christian Bale movie; he wants them to come see the character he\u2019s playing. That\u2019s true of most leading men working today. That wasn\u2019t true 20 years ago.\u201d\u000aNolan and Bale say they are both done with Batman\u2014although The Dark Knight Rises ends on a note that will allow another filmmaker to pick up the franchise where they left off. But Nolan, still a force behind Hollywood\u2019s superhero hegemony, is producing next year\u2019s Superman reboot, Man of Steel. The key to comic-book material, he insists, is to treat it as \u201ca source for movies of different types, not a genre\u2014if the comic-book movie is a genre, like the western, the audience will want something different.\u201d\u000aAs for his own directing future, \u201cI have no idea where I\u2019m going next,\u201d says Nolan. Down the road, a Bond movie would not be out of the question. And he doesn\u2019t even rule out 3D, if it\u2019s appropriate. \u201cI\u2019m all about choice,\u201d he declares. \u201cI don\u2019t like being told the way I should make a film.\u201d For one of the few filmmakers who can stand up to the studios, that may be the ultimate Hollywood superpower\u2014the ability to say no.

V The answer continues to be \u201cno.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d is a magnificent way to close out an exciting trilogy. After eight years of self-imposed exile, the caped crusader (Christian Bale) deals with an urban terrorist called Bane (Tom Hardy. )  Batman\u2019s alter ego, Bruce Wayne, hides away in Wayne Manor, but no longer. He emerges as well, after catching a young woman rifling his safe. The Catwoman\u2019s (Anne Hathaway) strange agenda is somehow connected to an overall master plot to bring Gotham City to its knees. Bane seems to have everything working to his advantage, but it\u2019s a grand mystery what he\u2019s up to. There are quite a few new characters in \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d and that\u2019s the way Nolan likes it. Nolan\u2019s films are intelligent, complex and scream for repeat viewings. Warner Brothers won\u2019t mind a bit. Just look how the director\u2019s earlier films have fared at the box office. I\u2019ve seen \u201cInception\u201d at least a dozen times and could watch it again tonight without thinking twice. Getting back to \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d that\u2019s about as much description as you will find in my review. Getting into the story is half the fun and I don\u2019t want to rob you of that pleasure. It\u2019s a story that demands your full attention. Besides the stellar screenplay and amazing cast, you just have to MARVEL at how Nolan interweaves his characters. And, unlike the second film, I found the last 45 minutes of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d to be the strongest act. The twists, the turns and the reveals are first-rate. Get out there, Batfans!

V Of course, the box office for \u201cA Good Day to Die Hard\u201d may tell a different story. Suffice it to say that the fifth film in the series is the weakest of the bunch. John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Russia to help his estranged son find his way out of prison. When he arrives, it seems Jack (Jai Courtney) doesn\u2019t need any help. An explosion at a Moscow courthouse destroys the building, killing just about everyone except, of course, Jack and his fellow inmate, a Russian whistleblower and all around rich guy (Sebastian Koch). The two escape with Bruce Willis in tow. That\u2019s about as much of the plot that I reveal here. Wait a minute! That\u2019s almost the entire plot. The rest of the film is a series of chases and explosions. So many, in fact, it reminds me of a monster truck rally. People go to them, but I honestly wonder why sometimes. The special effects were impressive, but unless you have a good story to go with it, they mean nothing. The story is dumbed down to the point that you question whether the writers even know whether Chernobyl (site of that massive nuclear disaster) is in Ukraine. \u201cA Good Day to Die Hard\u201d has a heavily armed helicopter cruising over to Chernobyl without even being challenged by the Ukrainian military. Not likely, since the two countries don\u2019t actually get along. This is just a big, dumb action flick written by people who don\u2019t seem to know even the most basic information about the former Soviet Union. To quote SCTV, \u201cMay the good lord take a likin\u2019 to you and blow you up real soon.\u201d

V All three legends bring the spice to a sub-par story. But, the total is not enough to keep this flick from stinking. Pacino is the just-released-from-prison Val. The guy who would rather do 28 years of hard time than give up his confederates. Nevertheless, a crime boss wants him dead and he\u2019s put the squeeze on Doc (Walken) to do the deed. In fact, Doc has only a few hours to complete the task or he\u2019ll also be toast. Val and Doc have a couple of adventures including a randy introduction to an ED drug and some action at a local brothel. Oh, yes, we\u2019ve been here before. \u201cStand Up Guys\u201d has nothing original to offer. The pace does pick up a bit when the duo decides to become a trio by rescuing their former getaway driver (Arkin) from a local rest home. When all three actors are together, you can almost forgive the mediocre writing, because it then becomes about three fun actors playing onscreen versions of their past characters. We love Pacino, Walken and Arkin. And, that makes \u201cStand Up Guys\u201d even harder to take.

V Of the weekend\u2019s four new releases reviewed here, only one qualifies as a horror movie\u2014Carrie. But there\u2019s more genuine horror in both 12 Years a Slave and A Touch of Sin than in Kimberly Pearce\u2019s post-feminist remake of Brian De Palma\u2019s classic. Steve\u2019s McQueen saga of 19-century bondage and Jia Zhangke\u2019s contemporary epic of vengeance in a corrupt China are  powerful pictures that confound us with jarring images of human brutality amid natural beauty. Both will likely find a place on my year-end top 10. As for The Fifth Estate, a thriller about unchained data, the horror is only of the psychological kind. But as played by Benedict Cumberbatch, protagonist Julian Assange could give Hannibal Lecter lessons in sangfroid. 12 Years A Slave\u000aOf the four films, 12 Years A Slave is by far the most harrowing, and momentous. There are still more films to come in 2013, but from where we stand now, it\u2019s shaping up to be the movie of the year. I haven\u2019t seen it since TIFF, but its images have not left me. Here\u2019s an expanded version of what I wrote about it at the time:\u000aEven though it\u2019s based on a true story that happened before the American Civil War, 12 Years A Slave waylays us with a sense of tremendous urgency. I say \u201cus,\u201d not just \u201cme,\u201d because I walked out of the theatre with that weight of collective sorrow you get from a good funeral. Leaving the cinema in a hushed congregation. Afraid to break the silence. Lost for words. Feeling that nothing I could say or write could begin to address the injustice, horror and degraded nobility that the movie so eloquently portrays. But I was left with contradictory responses. You wonder how a movie so hard to watch can be so ripe with beauty: the narrative is gilded with lush Southern landscapes that serve as a silent witness to the cruelty. You are amazed that the movie exists, such an opulent vision of atrocity, yet appalled that its story has taken so long to reach the screen. Not just this specific story, but the story of American slavery. Lurking in the background of so many Hollywood movies, it never been so fully represented until now. 12 Years A Slave is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a free black man in the North, and a skilled carpenter and fiddler, who was lured to Washington, D.C. by a pair of circus promoters in 1841, then kidnapped and sold into slavery in New Orleans. After the cartoonish pulp of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s exhilarating revenge fantasy, Django Unchained, Steve McQueen\u2019s epic is sobering, to say the least. Played with simmering yet titanic force by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Northup is no Django-like action hero. He is a literate, sophisticated man who struggles to defend his dignity as it is assaulted, diminished and ground into the dirt. McQueen has marshaled a strong cast. Benedict Cumberbatch has a smallish role as the plantation boss who first purchases him at auction. Although he has no compunction about separating a slave woman from her children, this patriarch\u2014who goes so far as to give Northup a violin\u2014is a relatively gentle man compared to his next owner, an alcoholic sadist named Epps (Michael Fassbender) who runs a cotton plantation. Yet Fassbender makes this monster utterly credible. As with Hunger and Shame,  McQueen doesn\u2019t pull any punches. There are scenes of unmitigated brutality, both a lynching and a flogging. Yet despite the extremity of the drama, McQueen has not crafted a black-and-white morality tale of good vs. evil. It\u2019s not relieved by the typical \u201ctriumph of the human spirit\u201d that passes for catharsis in Hollywood. It\u2019s too troubled and complex for that, as McQueen delves into the layers of compromise and guilt slaves endured in their struggle to survive. Northup isn\u2019t just a victim. He suffers the more nuanced indignity of collaboration, as he lives by his wits, using his education, while being careful not reveal too much of it. The heart of the narrative revolves around a young female slave named Patsey, the plantation\u2019s most productive cotton-picker, who becomes the target of Epps\u2019 sexual lust. Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2014a Mexican-born, Kenyan-raised graduate of Yale\u2019s film school\u2014makes her screen acting debut in this role, and her performance is a revelation. The movie\u2019s most wrenching scene is one in which she is whipped for what feels like an eternity. McQueen shoots it in a single unbroken shot, not allowing the camera, or the audience, to look away. Producer Brad Pitt made the movie happen, and gave himself a modest role as the story\u2019s white knight, a Canadian carpenter who eventually comes to Northup\u2019s rescue. But freedom comes as more of a sad denouement than a salvation. The tragedy cannot be undone. This is not a Brad Pitt movie, a tale of a white guy saving a slave; he\u2019s just the story\u2019s concierge. The film belongs to Chiwetel and the remarkable ensemble that surrounds him. With McQueen, they\u2019ve created a landmark picture of devastating power. Carrie\u000aChloe Moretz in 'Carrie'\u000aWhy remake Carrie? Good question, given that the original movie was so potent, and that Sissy Spacek\u2019s iconic performance as Carrie was so definitive. The 1976 movie that Brian De Palma adapted from Stephen King\u2019s novel has become a landmark of sorts. It\u2019s the original Mean Girls, a cautionary tale about high-school bullying with catastrophic consequences, made decades before social-media shaming pushed the issue to the fore. But if you are going to update Carrie, Kimberly Peirce, who made the Oscar-winning Boys Don\u2019t Cry (1999), that seminal movie about persecuted sexuality, would seem an interesting choice of director. You would expect this feminist filmmaker to take a radically different approach from De Palma, who opened his movie with voyeur\u2019s paradise of frontal nudity in the girls\u2019 shower room. But Peirce\u2019s 2.0 upgrade is not as different as you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s a very literal remake of the De Palma movie with some revisionist touches. First the differences. For those who don\u2019t want to wait all the way to the end for a blast of horror, Pearce kicks things off with a grisly childbirth scene, in which Carrie\u2019s screaming mother gives birth to her alone, and is torn between embracing this spawn of Satan or killing her with a pair of scissors. Then fast-forward to high school, and things start took look more familiar\u2014though Peirce, predictably,  eliminates even a soupcon of nudity in the shower sequence. She goes through the motions of making a post-feminist, post-Internet Carrie, set in the Facebook world of contemporary youth. The director dutifully incorporates the issue of cyber-bulling\u2014in the shower scene, after Carrie reacts to her first period with bewildered screams, a cellphone camera captures her humiliation as the girl mob pelts as her with tampons. The video will go viral. Chloe Moretz, who cut her baby teeth as the action star of Kick-Ass, may seem an apt choice for the lead. Yet she faces an impossible task. No one could top Spacek\u2019s visceral yet ethereal performance, which still seems utterly real almost four decades later. (I re-screened De Palma\u2019s film again this week.) And the Moretz version of the character is cut from different cloth. Spacek was a fragile, damaged creature who could see her own weirdness in the mirror. She channelled her telekinetic power as a terrifying force beyond her control, even in the end. Moretz is self-possessed right from the start. She gets a kick out of her powers and works to master them, like a nascent comic-book superhero, doing levitation exercises on the furniture and orchestrating flying objects with her hands. In one of the key changes from the original script, she turns her powers on Mom before heading off to the prom and locks her in the closet. She doesn\u2019t just dodge Mom\u2019s mad Christian rants; she corrects her: \u201cI didn\u2019t sin. You sinned!\u201d And in the final act, this heroic, hyper-conscious Carrie takes her vengeance much further than in the original. It\u2019s more protracted and diabolical. Plus, she\u2019s armed with an arsenal of digital special effects\u2014 Kick-Ass Carrie has powers that film technology could not dream of in 1976. Cast as her mother, Julianne Moore takes an even more marked departure from her original character, who was over-played by Piper Laurie. Though she got an Oscar nomination for her over-acting, Laurie\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t hold up\u2014her unmitigated hysteria flies way over the top, as if she\u2019s failing an audition for a Tennessee Williams play. Moore seems to have over-compensated, keeping the character on a low, psychotic simmer. She\u2019s a repressed knot of self-hatred. She\u2019s also acquired a habit of abusing herself by cutting and scratching her skin\u2014some clinical mortification of the flesh. To that extent, she is less of a villain, more a victim of her own self-hatred in Peirce\u2019s feminist-lite paradigm. Incidentally, the filmmakers have also upped the ante of high-school sexuality, adding a dash of teenage sex (as normal dating activity) and a pregnancy. But aside from all those tweaks, the new Carrie has been very closely cloned from the old one. Entire scenes, shots and lines of dialogue are recycled from the original. And the structure remains completely intact. It\u2019s as if Peirce and her screenwriters (Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aquirre-Sacasa) wanted to rehabilitate a classic and perform some cosmetic surgery, but were scared to mess with the bones of a story that worked so well in the first place. But by taking a safe, piecemeal approach\u2014and treating the original a sacred text rather than completely reinventing it\u2014the result at times seems weirdly anachronistic. Although fundamentalist Christianity is alive and well in America, it\u2019s much less likely these days that a schoolgirl of Carrie\u2019s age would be ignorant of menstruation. And although bullying is a serious problem in contemporary schools, it\u2019s also a hot-button issue. There\u2019s no apparent awareness of bullying among the characters, who seem stuck in a time warp. Which brings us back to the question, why remake the movie at all? There\u2019s a commercial rationale, of course. It\u2019s a property that can be re-packaged and resold for a young audience that hasn\u2019t seen the original. The problem is, Carrie has penetrated pop culture so deeply that even kids who haven\u2019t seen the 1976 movie are aware of it. How can can you shock people when it\u2019s impossible to spoil the ending: the blood-soaked girl in a prom dress is one of those images that\u2019s been permanently carved into the Halloween canon. Even Carrie\u2019s pig\u2019s-blood humiliation does not so tragic, because we are just waiting for her to unleash her superpowers. A Touch of Sin\u000aA Touch of Sin\u000aAgainst panoramic vistas, China\u2019s Jia Zhangke directs a suite of four stories splattered with vigilante gun violence, not all of it reprehensible. A kind of Chinese Pulp Fiction with a political pulse, it adds up to a powerful portrait of desperate individuals driven to extremes by official corruption and runaway commercial development. They range from a mine worker (Jiang Wu) who picks up a shotgun to get even with a super-rich boss, to a sauna attendant (Jia\u2019s wife and longtime leading lady Zhao Tao) who wreaks bloody vengeance against a sexual predator. As a contemporary revision of the W?xiá genre, these ultra-violent tales of explosive retribution are set against gorgeous landscapes in various far-flung corners of China. What\u2019s remarkable is that Jia partly based his stories on sensational real-life crimes that were well-known from the country\u2019s newspapers. They add up such a massive critique of China\u2019s new Cultural Revolution\u2014the decadence of unbridled state capitalism\u2014that it\u2019s surprising government censors have allowed the film to reach the screen. For my interview with the director, conducted during TIFF, go to: Jia Zhangke on violent redemption, censorship and Ai Wei Wei. The Fifth Estate\u000a(from left) Benedict Cumberbatch, Carice van Houten, Daniel Brühl, Moritz Bleibtreu in 'The Fifth Estate'\u000aThis breathless thriller that treats the speed of data as a matter of life and death. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Bill Condon (Kinsey, Dreamgirls), this propulsive drama does for Julian Assange what The Social Network did for Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg. It portrays him as a visionary who is pathologically insensitive, a genius with a cruel wit whose single-minded ambition leads him to betray his partners and his sources. But unlike Zuckerberg, who seems to have no higher goal in life that personal power, Assange comes across as a genuine revolutionary with a mission that unfolds like a sub-atomic particle accelerator. He\u2019s a cyber-hybrid of hero and villain. Like his long-suffering accomplice, Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl), we can\u2019t help but get caught up in his vortex, especially when the actor is Benedict Cumberbatch, who so on fire these days you wonder if he\u2019s human. Like the character, the film\u2019s narrative arc of ambition and betrayal is a construct that may be too conveniently symmetrical. Critics intimate with WikiLeaks claim that it is grossly one-sided, as it\u2019s based on Domscheit-Berg\u2019s book. But the issues raised by the film are compelling\u2014especially in the frenzied WikiLeaks negotiations with the mainstream press, which is personified by a Guardian editor played by the always-sharp David Thewlis. (There is, of course, nothing new about creating suspense from the largely silent and uneventful business of delivering news to a deadline\u2014the newsroom has been as exciting as the O.K. Corral for as long as Hollywood has been romancing journalism.) And to its credit, the film playfully cops to its own lack of impartiality. In an amusing post-modern coda, Assange speaks directly to the camera, questioning and ridiculing the very notion of a WikiLeaks movie.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aDespite reports to the contrary, Steve McQueen\u2019s Oscar-bait drama is not the greatest film ever made. It may well be the greatest film ever made about slavery, but that says more about the movie world than the work itself. Playing real-life free man Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1840\u2032s Louisiana, Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a typically strong performance. As do his starry co-stars \u2013 producer/saviour Brad Pitt, slave trader Paul Giamatti, progressive plantation owner Benedict Cumberbatch, and Solomon\u2019s main tormentor, psychotic owner Michael Fassbender \u2013 who inhabit a picaresque purgatory of almost Dickensian grotesquery. Like Tarantino before him, McQueen pulls no punches in the depiction and infliction of violence. Quite the opposite. Solomon is beaten until the whip breaks, Eliza (Adepero Oduye) wails as her children sold off. Meanwhile, the scene where poor Patsey (the excellent Lupita Nyong\u2019o) is whipped almost to death by a drunk, ranting Fassbender is so horrifying it eclipses the other 130 minutes. It\u2019s an unflinching film, and extremely well made, but it\u2019s also a limited one: overlong, schematic, a touch distant. Sometimes it seems McQueen is only comfortable showing the nadir of human behaviour, something borne out in both Shame and Hunger. And no matter what Solomon endures, he\u2019s never more than a noble cypher, a figure lost in the landscape. The ultimate irony is that, even with an incredible true story, a once-in-a-lifetime cast and much technical expertise at his disposal, McQueen still can\u2019t manage to make Solomon a person. Surely we\u2019ve come further than that?

V \u000a\u000a\u000aYou can\u2019t fault Disney for pitching The Lone Ranger as \u2018Pirates of the Wild West\u2019. But while you can hold a bright candle to that comparison, Gore Verbinski\u2019s ability to imitate the earnest enjoyment of its source material is what really shines through. The familiar greed, land confiscation, political corruption, and attempted genocide that come with screen depictions of American Natives vs. The White Man serve as background fodder here. The real story comes with Johnny Depp\u2019s Tonto moulding Armie Hammer\u2019s goody-two-shoes John Reid into the hero he could be \u2013 though he would have preferred his brother Dan Reid. It\u2019s all book-ended by an older Tonto retelling the adventure to a young-un \u2013 a narrative device that could have been chopped off the two-and-a-half hour running time. Johnny doesn\u2019t take his Jack Sparrow shtick to new Depp-ths, but Hammer feeds off his antics far better than Orlando Bloom ever did. William Fichtner brings a great cob of corn to his savage outlaw Butch, Helena Bonham Carter is effectively distracting as a dolled-up professional \u2018dancer\u2019 and Tom Wilkinson does a good Tom Wilkinson impression. It\u2019s too bad that Luther\u2019s Ruth Wilson is underused as a distressed damsel involved a weird incest-in-law romantic sub-plot. The constant wackiness of The Lone Ranger seems jarring in this modern age of frowny-faced blockbusters. Yet the cheesy tone acts as momentum to justify the creative absurdity of its finale, a dual train chase that features all manner of stunts that lean towards the right side of ridiculous. The result is an action sequence so vastly joyous that it nudges a three-star film into four-star territory.

V \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d stars Armie Hammer as the masked vigilante and Johnny Depp as his Indian sidekick, Tonto. The film opens in 1933 at a traveling sideshow where Tonto appears as part of the attraction. He\u2019s a bit older, of course. And, this kid dressed up as Woody in \u201cToy Story\u201d asks Tonto if the legend of The Lone Ranger was true, or just a story. Tonto relates his adventures although his memory appears foggy at times. He\u2019s got to be over 90, maybe a hundred. Anyway, John Reid (Hammer) is a prosecuting attorney determined to bring peace and justice to Texas as the transcontinental railroad is linked. He doesn\u2019t fare well after being deputized as a Texas Ranger by his brother so he can help bring an escaped killer to justice. His brother is killed, but Reid won\u2019t see red. He still believes that everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Ho hum! \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d is the story of how Reid gets his mind changed on how to dispense the law. Tonto and Reid find a common interest, revenge. But, they initially don\u2019t get along. Depp brings his usual quirkiness to the role of Tonto. He\u2019s often amusing. But, Hammer is plain vanilla as the masked lawman. He never quite makes the role truly his. And, his transformation to vigilante trods along without much real emotion. On the down side, the film is way too long at two and a half hours. Way too violent for Disney. And, quite anachronistic. That\u2019s a fancy word for stuff that ain\u2019t supposed to be in the film\u2019s time period. All movies suffer from this. But, you seem to take better notice when you\u2019re bored. \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d certainly won\u2019t revive the western genre. Move along, little doggie.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aFilled to the brim as it was with some of the finest older British actors around, 2012\u2032s sleeper smash The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was often referred to as \u2018The Avengers for pensioners\u2019. Which I suppose would make this follow-up \u2018Age of Ultron for pensioners\u2019. The level of quality sustained in this sequel bodes well for Joss Whedon\u2019s impending blockbuster. The superlatively talented cast is effortlessly engaging, and while there isn\u2019t a huge amount of drama in their various arcs, it\u2019s still a significant delight to spend more time in their company. Maggie Smith in particular is the heart and soul of these films, and this often feels like a well-deserved ode to her unique charms. Bill Nighy and Judi Dench also manage to inject some life into the well-worn \u2018Will they or won\u2019t they?\u2019 trope. New cast additions Richard Gere and Tamsin Grieg (the Quicksilver Fox and Scarlet Witch of this film?) fit into the environment nicely, with Gere once again proving his worth as an old-fashioned romantic leading man. A misjudged subplot about murder-for-hire aside, this rarely puts a foot wrong. More sequels could stand to be this tuned in to what their audiences want.
