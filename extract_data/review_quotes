V\u000aIn virtue of the fact that it's a story told via a sequence of recorded images projected in swift succession to give the illusion of movement, Step Up 3D can be classified as a film. But it's certainly not the type of thing we're normally talking about when we talk about a film. It's more like a circus, or a West End musical, mixed with the cliches of sports movies and rom-coms into a cheese-infused broth of doubtful artistic value.\u000aA decent script, believable characters, acting ability - measured against any of these traditional benchmarks, Step Up 3D is horrendous. But, as with many classic action movies, these things are simply irrelevant to Step Up 3D. In place of the one-note characters, ridiculous plotting and spectacular explosions offered by said action movies, Step Up 3D offers one-note characters, ridiculous plotting and spectacular 3D dance sequences. If the idea of spectacular 3D dance sequences thrills you, this is your movie. If it does not, you now know all you need to know about Step Up 3D and can leave this page. Perhaps you'd like to read about some world cinema? Other current cinema releases? Or maybe have a look at what's on telly? Enjoy.  So anyway, spectacle fans, now the player haters have left, let's jam. The first five minutes of Step Up 3D are everything you might fear. Inside these first minutes, people talk super earnestly to camera, saying things like "dance has vocabulary", "everybody's a dancer" and "maybe we're all plugged into the same song." Yuck. Don't worry, minutes later we're plunged into a New York breakdance sequence that transfers us - via a police chase conducted using the medium of dance-inflected parkour (used for no good reason to jump through a hotdog stand) - to the warehouse/nightclub that our lead hunk o' bland (Rick Malambri) introduces thusly: "Welcome to my house. The house of pirates."  This is, needless to say, hilarious, and once you realise you're essentially watching a kind of latter day JM Barrie's Lost Boys with a penchant for limited edition gun-metal Nikes and implausible dance routines, the whole thing makes sense and you can sit back, soak up the audacious choreography and wee yourself laughing at the overblown cliches, camp dialogue and utter seriousness with which the actors appear to be taking this arrant nonsense. How can you not find a space in your heart for a 21st century villain saddled with the name Julien? Or with the guy tasked with hissing "What are you doing here, Julien?" with a straight face. This is pure tosh, but in such a goofy, harebrained way that I found it impossible to dislike.\u000aIn a nutshell: It's called Step Up 3D, and entirely lives up to what that title  promises. In the parlance of the dancers, it's totally B.FAB. That's  'born from a boombox', for those of us not fortunate enough to count the  boombox amongst our progenitors.\u000aBy Catherine Bray\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000aEyebrows were raised when Martin Scorsese\u2019s real-life drama was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Musical Or Comedy. Although the soundtrack (including covers of Goldfinger and Mrs Robinson) is excellent, and it is Scorsese\u2019s funniest film by some distance, Wolf is neither musical nor comedy, more a riotously dayglo Goodfellas.\u000aBeginning in a whir of crashing helicopters and tossed dwarves, it\u2019s a filthy, fizzy ride following the spectacular rise and predictable fall of 1980s stock market fraudster Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). But between the cameos (Matthew McConaughey, Joanna Lumley, Spike Jonze), globetrotting (London, Las Vegas, Auckland) and endless debauchery, there\u2019s a scabrous joie de vivre that\u2019s impossible to resist. One scene sees Belfort vividly miming anal sex while closing a sale with a clueless client. Another has him and his colleagues enjoying themselves on a coke-and-hooker-filled private jet. Multiply that by 180 minutes and you have some idea what you\u2019re getting into.\u000aThough brilliantly written (by Boardwalk Empire\u2018s Terence Winter), acted and directed, Wolf is dangerously overlong. This is especially galling because Belfort often speaks directly to the audience to speed the action on. Couldn\u2019t he have whizzed us through the details of his downfall the same way? The only excuse is that the material is just too juicy to cut, and everyone, from a career-best DiCaprio, to his crack-smoking sidekick Jonah Hill, to Scorsese himself is having too good a time to stop. For at least two of the three hours, you will be too. Maybe those Golden Globe guys were on to something after all.\u000a\u2018The Wolf of Wall Street\u2019 movie times\u000a\u000a

VRent this film now on Film4oD\u000a \u000aIf anyone's going to succeed in demonstrating how fresh-faced recruits can be reduced to machines during military training, it's Stanley Kubrick, a director not known for warm, fuzzy portrayals of humanity. Weirdly, by delivering this message so unflinchingly, Full Metal Jacket emerges as one of Kubrick's most engaging films, never letting us forget precisely what its lead characters have lost. Following a perfunctory title card, we get straight down to business with a montage of recruits getting their heads shaved in no-nonsense fashion. Given Kubrick's reputation for endless retakes, it's a wonder this scene didn't take several years as actors waited for their hair to grow back. Significantly, we're given no character backstory, no call-up papers, tearful farewells or lonely sunsets - our first glimpse of the leads is two rows of identical bald bodies with Sergeant Hartman (real-life marine drill instructor Ermey) barking out his intention of breaking the men down, while employing an impressive lexicon of florid insults. All of this establishes the film's atmosphere as nightmarish black comedy, dispelling comparisons with its more ponderous contemporary Platoon. Ermey's performance as the foul-mouthed Hartman is justly celebrated and it's difficult to imagine the film working anything like as effectively without him. Watching the relentless bullying of useless gutbucket Pyle (D'Onofrio) is simultaneously heartbreaking and hilarious thanks to the barrage of abuse coming from the exasperated Hartman. Modine's Joker (most of the characters are referred to solely by nicknames in a further de-humanising touch) is the film's focus, maintaining a sarcastic attitude throughout while being constantly aware of the horrendous situation he's living through. It's a considerable achievement that Joker can flip between appalling John Wayne impersonations and potentially toe-curling mediations such as "the dead know only one thing: it is better to be alive," while remaining a consistent, believable character.Despite assurances from those involved in its making that Full Metal Jacket was subject to Kubrick's typically extended shooting schedule and attention to detail, there's a willingness to move things along with none of the leisurely pacing that can make a viewing of 2001 or Barry Lyndon such a daunting prospect. Instead, the recruits' cliched transformation via montage into a team of precision drilled troops is rapidly turned around, provoking a sense of despair rather than triumph; their journey accompanied by a selection of crude, sex-based call-and-response marching songs as opposed to Survivor's 'Eye Of The Tiger'. The training portion of the film is far more striking than second and longer section which re-creates the savage 1968 Tet offensive. Due to his fear of flying, Kubrick famously recreated his Saigon in East London's Isle of Dogs using derelict buildings and a few imported palm trees. Admittedly, the ploy works a treat (the grey English sky is unmistakable, an effect which makes the battlefield appear unearthly) and the first sign that we're in Blighty comes when the British film industry's favourite Yank in residence, Bruce Boa - famous for demanding a Waldorf salad in 'Fawlty Towers' - crops up, demanding to know why Joker wears a peace badge while his helmet bears the legend 'Born to Kill'. Comments about the duality of man fall on predictably deaf ears. That the film comes to such an abrupt halt is also something of a surprise, especially given its running time of a very un-Kubrickian 112 minutes. That's not to suggest Full Metal Jacket feels either rushed or unfinished; if anything, it demonstrates just how clear and precise the director's vision could be when he resisted a fatal tendency for indulgence.

VThe true story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a shrewd, Mafia-connected casino operator, whose assured, mannered existence is undone by his devotion to his flighty wife, Ginger and his boyhood friend Nicky (Joe Pesci), a wild card who fancies his chances on Ace's patch.  De Niro and Pesci narrate the extended opening, detailing the mechanics of skimming money from the casino to pass onto the bosses back home. This sequence ends with the glorious introduction of Sharon Stone's showgirl hustler Ginger, all fur, jewels and blonde ambition, who casts gambling chips into the air. On a security monitor, De Niro watches her exuberant transgression, and falls in love. So begins his downfall, and the end of Mob rule in Vegas.  Where GoodFellas explored the allure of being a Brooklyn wise guy, with a hair-trigger comic sensibility, Casino emphasises the remorseless fear and grind of a mobster's life, all its attraction purged in two horrifically violent set-pieces. One, a torture scene with a vice, has been rightly condemned as gratuitous - but it is the closing beating that truly disturbs, two men brutally disfigured by repeated whacks with metallic bats that, as they are tipped into the grave, their featureless faces frozen in a contorted howl, it's almost as if a new species has emerged from the violence, only to be suddenly, cruelly, aborted. There is no romanticism in this view of the Mafia. Scorsese making a gangster film with Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro raised no eyebrows, and led some critics to accuse him of hitting a rut. All the same, with its ferocity and maturity, particularly in the responsibilities weighing upon the wise guys, Casino can be seen a closing chapter in the evolution of a gangster community, from its street heyday in Mean Streets to its adjustment to the new drug trade in Goodfellas to its final giving way to the power of  the corporations in the eighties.

I couldn\u2019t get that thought out of my mind while watching this visually taxing and noisy spy spoof. Certainly, there is plenty going on in this send up of the British spy genre, not all of it good.\u000aColin Firth stars as secret agent Harry Hart, one of a select group of highly trained operatives, known collectively as Kingsman. The bureau recruits British youth to join them, when there\u2019s a rare opening caused by an agent dying in the line of duty. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) a twenty-something who dresses like rap star Eminem, is asked by Harry to try his luck at the rigorous training program. Much of the film concerns the indoctrination procedures, and I found that to be strike one. The dull preliminaries seemed to last for almost the film\u2019s length. Too much training and not enough story. Get on with it.\u000aWhen the story finally gets going, we learn that billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has a plan to combat global warming and it\u2019s not exactly people-friendly. Why is the master villain someone who recognizes climate change as a problem that needs to be addressed? Were the producers pushing some redneck buttons by making the bad guy a believer in earth sciences? Strike two.\u000aBefore launching his plan, Valentine seeks to control the world\u2019s political leaders by inserting an explosive charge into each of their necks, meaning, step out of line, and your head will burst. Many luminaries go along with Valentine\u2019s plan, agreeing to the implants. One of those leaders is apparently President Obama (America\u2019s favorite racial target). It\u2019s possible that the actors didn\u2019t know about the director\u2019s plans to kill the Obama lookalike and his cabinet. These scenes were filmed separately. I can\u2019t see Sam Jackson going along with this, but perhaps he did. The film wasn\u2019t funny in the first place. Now, it was downright Rupert Murdochian. The very conservative Murdoch owns Fox News and 20th Century Fox, the company that released the film. What kind of political message were they sending movie audiences? The scenes in question admittedly happen very fast. Perhaps they were looking for a subliminal effect. Strike three.\u000aNow, I wasn\u2019t having a very good time to start with, so perhaps the political messages stood out more with me than your average moviegover. I found \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service\u201d to be derivative, loud and overly broad. Jackson\u2019s lisping billionaire was fun for a while, but then started to get on my nerves. Firth was downright dull. And, Egerton displayed nothing to recommend a future career in acting. Spy spoofs should be fun. What happened? Grade: D+\u000aWhere\u2019s Q Branch when you need it?

VIt's rare for a sequel to outstrip its predecessor, but Toy Story 2 succeeds admirably. The characters - cowboy doll Woody, space ranger Buzz Lightyear and their plaything sidekicks - are comfortable and familiar now. The story, however, moves up a gear - Woody is bought to complete a set of rare collectibles and is torn between returning to his child owner or being shipped off to Japan (the one major fault with the film can be found here - a seemingly anti-Japanese, pro-American sub-text that leaves something of a nasty taste). The makers provide the sort of broad knockabout humour and gobsmacking effects (the finale is scintillating) that you've come to expect from this franchise. Meanwhile, director Lasseter tugs the heartstrings by posing the question of what happens to broken toys, or those whose owners have outgrown them, while managing to make the first film's central joke (Buzz's conviction that he is a real space ranger) even funnier this time round.\u000a																\u000a																And what of the 3D version, released January 2010? As you'd expect from this studio, it's a treat for the eyes, with standout sequences including an opening scene that zooms through Zurg's perilous fortress with what would be deadly speed and cunning camerawork if it were real. As is, it drips with the panache and humour that put Pixar ahead of the competition. The 3D on offer throughout is done with style, making this a perfect present for Pixar fans looking for a pre-meal appetiser ahead of the anticipated visual feast of Toy Story 3 in July 2010. If you're a parent to children young enough not to have seen Toy Story 2 in cinemas the first time around, this is quite simply a must.\u000aClick here to read a history of Pixar\u000aClick here for the top ten 3D moments in Toy Story 2

V\u000aLike pretty much all anime, Princess Mononoke builds toward cataclysm. It's understandable that mass destruction is a recurrent theme - after all, Japan is the only country to have suffered the atomic bomb first hand. However, whereas most anime films feature high-tech battles in modern cities, Princess Mononoke's climactic destruction has a refreshingly different setting - a mythologised 14th century landscape. This setting is brought to life with utter magnificence by anime master Hayao Miyazaki - who has been praised in no uncertain terms by the likes of Toy Story creator John Lasseter ("Not a day goes by that I do not utilize the tools learned from studying his films"). Despite the period setting, the themes of the film are pertinent and modern: the effects of the human drive to better ourselves through technology, and the environmental repercussions of such ambition.\u000aThe hero of the piece is Ashitaka (voiced in Neil Gaiman's English translation by Billy Crudup), a young warrior prince who contracts a terminal infection while protecting his village from a horrifying marauding demon. Ashitaka discovers that a war is being waged between humanity and nature when he meets Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), a matriarch who has founded a city to smelt iron and manufacture firearms. Eboshi's chief enemy is San, or Princess Mononoke (voiced with inappropriate brattiness by Claire Danes), the adopted human daughter of Moro (Gillian Anderson), a wolf god, whose clan, along with the boar clan and the other forest creatures, is suffering from Eboshi's ruthless deforestation.\u000aAvoiding pastoral sentimentality and a simple condemnation of human technological progress, Princess Mononoke is a complex, intriguing moral tale. With her reliance on iron and gunpowder, Eboshi exemplifies human drive at the expense of the environment. But even she has a moral dimension - her employees are women she liberates from a life in brothels, lepers and other outcasts, whose dignity she restores. Her actions and ambitions challenge the supremacy of the traditional feudal overlords. Even the hero, Ashitaka, is ambivalent - he's loyal to neither the humans nor the magic animals, instead he tries to mediate ("What I want is for the humans and the forest to live together in peace," he says with earnest simplicity.) Despite the familiar cartoon look of the characters, the film's overall artistry - which merits comparison with Terrence Malick and Akira Kurosawa in places - matches the sophistication of its story.\u000aIn a nutshell: All Miyazaki's films are masterpieces, but Princess Mononoke may just have the edge. One of the greatest anime films ever made.\u000aBy Daniel Etherington\u000a

VPowerful and haunting sci-fi parable imbued by Tarkovsky with a multi-layered visual resonance and, despite its stately pace, raw emotional impact.
p25
sg4
VAndrei Tarkovsky's follow-up to Mirror (aka Zerkalo, 1975) was this equally uncompromising, dark science fiction parable. Stalker is a kind of bleak Russian spin on The Wizard Of Oz, in which the characters exist in a dreary world alternating between monochrome and washed-out colour. \u000a																\u000a																Like its predecessor, this film tells the story of a quest, here an illicit journey undertaken by the Stalker of the title (Kaidanovsky), leading two men, the Writer (Solonitsin) and the Scientist (Grinko), into 'The Zone'. This is an eerie, unpopulated, mysteriously contaminated region, fenced off and guarded by the army. People who go there rarely return - unless they are guided by the oddly empathic Stalkers. At the heart of The Zone lies 'The Room', where, according to legend, people's dreams can come true. As the men's perilous journey progresses, however, it becomes evident that it's not so much The Zone that they have to fear, rather its their uncertainty over their deepest wishes, and the promise of them being realised.\u000a																Tarkovsky pared down the source novel, 'Roadside Picnic' by esteemed Russian science fiction authors the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, eliminating its narrative clarity and defined resolution. He created instead an opaque work of art filled with powerful, unsettling images and not, as he insisted, symbols - although it is almost impossible to read certain images and themes as bearing anything other than specifically Christian significance. One particularly telling scene involves the men's wary transition of the antechamber to The Room; it's a large space covered with miniature sand dunes and scattered weapons, money, needles and religious items - all symbols of human power, longing and escape. \u000a																\u000a																As in all Tarkovsky's films, Stalker requires patience and an acceptance of its easy pace. Once you surrender yourself to the insistent rhythm of this profound, starkly beautiful film you will be further persuaded that Tarkovsky is one of cinema's true poets.\u000a

Vin Pan's Labyrinth, the world of Ofelia's imagination and the realities of Falangist Spain are two different, ideologically opposed ways of telling the same story - a story of tyranny, resistance and the timeless struggle between good and evil.
p28
sg4
V\u000aIn the imagination of filmmakers, there is something about the horrors of the Spanish Civil War and its immediate aftermath that lends itself to the innocent, often fanciful perspective of a child. So Victor Erice's The Spirit Of The Beehive (1973) presented an idyllic Spanish postwar countryside through the eyes of a girl obsessed with James Whale's Frankenstein, and Guillermo Del Toro's The Devil's Backbone (2001) seamlessly merged the inexorable advance of fascism with a ghost story unfolding in a rural school for boys. Pan's Labyrinth is a sister film to The Devil's Backbone, and similarly blends historical realism with more genre-bound fantasy elements to create an expansive, visionary and moving examination of Spain's darkest chapter of the last century.\u000aIt is 1944, at the end of the Civil War, a time when idealism and innocence are taking their final, doomed stand. With her father dead, bookish young Ofélia (Ivana Baquero) is brought to the country outpost of her pregnant mother's new man, the fascist Captain Vidal (Sergi López), who is ruthlessly engaged in rooting out the last remnants of a ragtag guerrilla group hidden in the neighbouring woods.\u000aVidal's head housekeeper (Maribel Verdú) and doctor (Álex Angulo) are both secretly helping the resistance as best they can, and Ofélia too defies Vidal's monolithic worldview by retreating into her own fairytale imagination. After following a locust-like fairy into an ancient labyrinth bordering the estate, Ofélia meets the forest spirit Pan (Doug Jones), who sets her three tasks involving a giant greedy toad, the terrifying Pale Man (who devours children and holds his eyes in the palms of his hands), and the shedding of innocent blood. Meanwhile outside, an altogether more real monster awaits, torturing and murdering anyone who stands in his way.\u000a"You'll see that life is not like your fairy tales." So Ofélia is told by her mother Carmen (played by the appropriately named Ariadna Gil), in one of several attempts to wean the young innocent off the high ideals and straightforward morality of her beloved fiction, where bravery and purity are rewarded with living happily ever after. Carmen has, after all, allowed herself to become inextricably compromised, marrying her own and her children's fates to the rise of fascism. Yet in Pan's Labyrinth, the world of Ofélia's imagination and the realities of Falangist Spain run in curious parallel as two different, ideologically opposed ways of telling the same story - a story of tyranny, resistance and the timeless struggle between good and evil.Ofélia's trials may be fanciful, but the woodland strife, mythical beasts, heroic acts, purloined keys, forbidden feasts and troubled births that constitute their essential furniture all reflect, through a glass darkly, the actual conflicts taking place around her, while the deadly reality of the dangers faced by the girl and others is never in any doubt. The result is a Franco-era Brazil, where events outside and inside the mind gradually become indistinguishable as each allegorises and informs the other, so that the ending can be regarded as both horrifically tragic and redemptively triumphant at the same time - all depending on the limits of the viewer's own imagination. From Cronos to Mimic to Blade II to Hellboy, Del Toro has always been associated with horror, but even if Pan's Labyrinth has its fair share of grotesquerie, brutality and visceral shocks, it is a film unbounded by genre, all at once children's fantasy, adult parable, historical drama and more, located at a magical crossroads where Labyrinth meets The Shining and Land And Freedom meets Ichi The Killer. Del Toro and his effects crew have crafted an exquisite fairytale world whose phantasmagorical spectacle is never anything less than integral to the film. The performances are flawless (especially López as the clean-shaven face of horror), the transitions from reality to fantasy and back again are beguiling, and the viewer always has the sense of watching something not just gripping, but also of vital importance.\u000a

The pulsating action coincides exactly with the 85 minutes' running time, as well as brilliantly setting the marshal in isolation among the ominous wooden buildings and dusty streets of a small frontier town.It was the high point of Fred Zinnemann's career, and Gary Cooper, in his Oscar-winning role - at 51, his handsome face lined and drawn - gives possibly the most poignant and profound performance to be found in any western.No doubt Sergio Leone remembered the movie (in which Leone star Van Cleef makes his debut) when he embarked on his homages to the American West, while Ennio Morricone has echoed the effective use of the 'Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling' song on the soundtrack.

VFollowing on from the huge success of Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, Paul Newman and Robert Redford teamed up once again with director George Roy Hill to make this slick crime caper.  First released in 1973, the joke at the time was that the stars had simply swapped moustaches since The Sting was, to all intents and purposes, a reinterpretation of their earlier outlaw roles as Butch and Sundance. However, massive box office takings and seven Academy Awards (it trounced The Exorcist in most categories) quickly conferred classic status upon it. Was such acclaim deserved? Not really, but given the subject matter there's a delicious irony in the fact that such a good-looking, efficiently constructed and commercially-oriented film pulled a fast one over the critics and Academy voters.Set in Chicago in 1936, Redford stars as short-con operator Johnny Hooker who, together with long-term mentor Luther (Jones), unwittingly rips off $5000 from menacing Irish mobster Lonegan (Shaw). When Lonegan's henchmen kill Luther, Johnny wants revenge and seeks out Henry Gondorff (Newman), a washed-up, but still wily, confidence trickster to help him take Lonegan for half-a-million dollars.  Working from a tightly constructed script by David S Ward, both leads have an easygoing chemistry that Hill exploits with a lightness of touch that keeps proceedings moving at a brisk pace. The anachronistic ragtime score, sepia-tinged cinematography and romanticised period details gave the film a deliberately old fashioned feel back in 1973, with means that it hasn't dated. Watched now, it's still an exhilarating film that delights in showing us the machinations of the con, yet keeps its cards close enough to its chest to keep us guessing right up to the final reel. An exquisite example of an empty genre, its influence can be seen most obviously in Steven Soderbergh's lovable crook caper Ocean's Eleven, not to mention a raft of inferior heist movies.

VJapanese animation - anime - repeatedly comes back to the same debate: about the perils of advances in technology; and the same motifs: social decay, the vast metropolis, the human-like robot, the cataclysmic disaster. All these elements are present and correct in Metropolis. Not surprisingly, as it's adapted by Katsuhiro Ôtomo, the creator of the benchmark Akira manga and anime and is based on 1949 manga created by Osama Tezuka, a godfather figure for these key Japanese media. But there's more history to this film than that - Tezuka's manga was, of course, inspired by Fritz Lang's 1926 classic film, which casts a long shadow over much subsequent sci-fi. \u000a																\u000a																The city-state of Metropolis is a giant, hi-tech, multi-layered place - imagine modern Singapore, Hong Kong or Tokyo reimagined by a 20s or 30s sci-fi visionary. Despite a puppet president, the city is actually ruled by the devious Duke Red (Ishida) and a fascistic militia led by his gun-toting adopted son, Rock (Okada). As in Lang's Metropolis, beneath the wealth and achievement there exists an underclass - humans disenfranchised by robot labourers, themselves another marginalised group. \u000a																The robot-hating Rock is perturbed when he discovers Red is employing renegade scientist Dr Laughton to create a "superhuman" robot modelled on Red's dead daughter. Japanese detective Shunsuka Ban (Tomita) and his nephew sidekick, Kenichi (Kobayashi), who are seeking Laughton, arrive on the scene just after Rock has trashed Laughton's lab. In the confusion, Kenichi falls in with the 'newborn' robot, Tima (Imoto), who slowly learns about her nature and destiny.\u000a																\u000a																Even sci-fi fans may be confounded by the fevered riffing on anime's favourite themes. Robots believing they are human is a familiar scenario, notably from Spielberg's A.I.. But the issues arising from the threat of rampant technology are confusing - particularly in the paradox that sentient robots personify the threat of technology to humanity, but are themselves victims. \u000a																\u000a																There's also a problem with the style of the characters. Rather than opting for the proportionate style of Akira or Ghost In A Shell, the humans here are in the more childish, 'classic' manga style - which evolved from early Disney cartoons - and look like squashed 'Tin Tin' characters. Presumably this is in keeping with the retro-futurism of the whole affair, however it jars with the settings, which, realised through a combination of CG and cel animation, are magnificent, atmospheric, highly detailed and sometimes photorealistic. Indeed, the film works best for this sheer spectacle.

Out clubbing to celebrate her promotion, Alison has too much to drink, falls for Ben's dopey moves and takes him back to their place for sex: "It's a good job I am drunk - this is taking forever," exclaims Ben, revealing a little too much of the inner monologue of a man holding up his end of the one-night-stand bargain.

Likewise 'The Royle Family' - it's easy to forget how appalled commentators were at the first episodes of Caroline Aherne's series, utterly shocked by its realistic depiction of working class family for laughs as opposed to kitchen sink tragedy. In 2006, Sacha Baron Cohen took a direct route to comic realism, throwing himself upon the mercy of the real world for Borat, incurring various legal suits for exposing the unflattering opinions of the people caught up in his prank.If groundbreaking comedy is about telling it like it is, instead of telling it like it was, then Knocked Up makes it halfway to classic status. The 40 Year-Old Virgin was sweet but had - at its heart - the unbelievable conceit of Steve Carell going through adulthood without getting laid. Elsewhere in Hollywood, post-American Pie gross-out has worn out its gag reflex. The Wayans brothers are presumably working on Little Man 2. With Blades Of Glory Will Ferrell and Co's improvisations finally disappeared off into a hyperreality of indulgence (Apatow was producer on Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy and Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby but did not write the scripts). Wedding Crashers and its ilk run out of steam as soon as their set-ups are done. Someone, somewhere is rubbing more talc into Eddie Murphy's fat suit.  Knocked Up comes closer to the truth, is funnier as a consequence, and will reinvigorate the mainstream romantic comedy (yes, that is a good thing). It captures the barely-restrained panic of the delivery suite, where stressed doctors and expectant fathers clash. We are introduced to the male anxieties around pregnancy sex. With wry sadness, it charts the day a man must put aside his bong and get a job. More surprisingly, it interrogates the over-planned domesticity of the middle class marriage, with Susan's remark that her younger sister "must train him" nailing the mutual oppression couples can fall into.  A 'Newsweek' article by Jennie Yabroff identified Knocked Up as indicative of a cultural trend toward beta males. Only in America's ruthless 'Rules'-inspired dating culture would two thousand words about post-9/11 cultural deflation and the national humiliation of Iraq be required to explain why a successful media hottie could end up with a doofus with love handles. Ben may have moobs and no job, but at least he is sweet and nurturing - an underrated quality in Hollywood (as Alison quivers, at the height of her vulnerability, "don't fuck me over").  In 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Larry David used improvisation within a strict structure to combine realism with the comic rewards of the reverses and twists of tight plotting. Director Judd Apatow transfers that formula to the big screen. The downside is all those improvised blind alleys that get shoehorned into the DVD release so that the distributors can boast of "40 minutes of unused material" - the lengthy DVD cut of The 40 Year Old Virgin drags its feet like a month without sex. In Knocked Up, there is a magic mushrooms in Vegas interlude that shows us how useless men are when left to indulge themselves that scores cheap drug gags at the expense of the hard-won relationship humour that represent the film's comic triumph. Otherwise, this is the birth of something special.

VIt's very much of its time, overblown and overlong -- but Ben-Hur is rightfully lodged at the forefront of Hollywood history.

VWith TV threatening cinema's entertainment hegemony in the 1950s, movie producers reacted by making films bigger, longer, grander, extraordinarily expensive and packing them with exciting spectacle. Of course, the historical epic had always been an element of movie-makers' output, but its popularity had come and gone. The coming of sound and the Depression had seen Hollywood decrease its production of bloated spectacle films in the 1930s, but the time was ripe again in the 1950s.   The advent of a suitably grand new cinema technology - widescreen - was central to the overall fattening of the movie experience as represented by the historical epic event movies. 1953's The Robe had introduced Fox's patented CinemaScope; the other studios soon followed suit, all grasping at developments that would keep the threat of TV at bay. MGM's Ben-Hur is the quintessential product of this atmosphere of panic and conscious excess.Based on the 19th century bestseller, and influenced by MGM's silent version of the story from 1925, Ben-Hur recounts, in almost four hours, the travails of Judah Ben-Hur (Heston). A Jewish prince at the time of Christ, Ben-Hur comes into conflict with childhood friend Messala (Boyd), a Roman who is in command of the Roman legions that are holding Judah's people in subjugation. Cue a patchy odyssey that sees our hero surviving sea battles as a galley slave, being adopted by a Roman noble and returning to challenge Messala in the mother of all chariot races. Oh, and along the way having passing encounters with Christ.   Despite being tweaked by such literary honoraries as Gore Vidal and Christopher Fry, the dialogue of Ben-Hur encompasses leadenness, pomposity and sanctimony. But Heston, at the height of his heavy-browed, hero-inhabiting powers, gives the film a stalwart focus, while participating in action-packed set-pieces that show 50s special effects at their most dramatic.

V\u000aBen Stiller and his friends from the American Museum of Natural History visit London in \u201cNight at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb.\u201d\u000aYou may not find many original moments in the corny humor of \u201cNight at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb.\u201d But, you will enjoy time spent with old friends in this third and final film in the series. Ben Stiller and company create more than a few warm and fuzzies.\u000aThis time the fantasy premise jumps the pond to the British Museum in London. The ancient Egyptian widget that keeps the exhibits alive in America is corroding, and museum guard Larry Daley (Stiller) must find out why. The young pharaoh, Ahkmenrah (Rami Malek) tells Daley, he should consult with his father, Merenkahre (Ben Kingsley) at the London institution on what to do. Many of Daley\u2019s exhibits at the American Museum of Natural History secretly hitch a ride overseas. Making the trip: Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams), Jedediah (Owen Wilson), Octavius (Steve Coogan), Sacagawea (Mizuo Peck) and Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher). Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a family reunion without Ahkmenrah tagging along.\u000aDaley and his son, Nicky (Styler Gisondo replacing Jake Cherry), sneak into the British Museum after delivering a large crate carrying the American exhibits. And, of course, the entire institution springs to life thanks to the ancient widget, despite its oxidation. They even get to meet Sir Lancelot (Dan Stevens), who amusingly doesn\u2019t understand that he never existed. Camelot, he is told, was just a legend. Lance is handsome, but not too smart. It doesn\u2019t register right away. This character can be taxing, but ultimately he\u2019s quite entertaining.\u000aAs I said before, \u201cNight at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\u201d won\u2019t draw raves for originality. It\u2019s familiarity and sentimentality that rule the day.\u000aThis was the final film for Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams. Both are greatly missed by Hollywood and the circumstances of Williams\u2019 death, in particular, make his presence more meaningful.\u000aPerhaps the story is contrived and the producers were out to make a few bucks. \u201cNight at the Museum 3\u2033 is a feel-good movie, and that counts for something.\u000aTech credits are fine. The special effects seem a bit old-fashioned, but they work. The acting is about what you\u2019d expect in a big-budget all-star vehicle. Everyone has their moment. I particularly liked Stiller playing off himself as Daley meets Laaa, a Neanderthal who could be his doppelgänger. Some might think that the routine goes a bit too long. I found the repetition is what made it funny.\u000aIf you\u2019re okay with the potty humor from the first two films, then you certainly won\u2019t mind the third. I think maybe the monkey urinating might be the most bawdy moment. And, you know kids. They love that kind of stuff.\u000a\u201cNight at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\u201d was a pleasant surprise.

V\u000aThere are moments, early on, when you worry if it is going to turn out alright. Can he pull it off? Is there really a happy ending to this epic, the adventures of one director and his collaborators to craft a trilogy that will not only dominate the box office of the early 21st century, not only raise the bar for blockbuster films, but in the end - for all its battles, creatures and plucky little hobbits - actually mean something?\u000aThis quest is imperiled early on in The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King; you doubt if there are any surprises left in the bag. After the two astonishing innovations of The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers - Gollum and the stomping legions at the battle of Helm's Deep - the first few bars of Return Of The King still carry the echoes of the previous film. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are celebrating the victory at Helm's Deep in the halls of Rohan, while Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) are still on their trek into Mordor. There is a striking prologue that takes us back to the crucial moment in Gollum's life, when he was still a simple Riverfolk called Smeagol, but as we riffle through the various sub-plots and characters of the trilogy, reviving them with a scene here, a speech there, the apprehension arises that Return Of The King will disappoint. There are too many slo-mos set to pan pipes, there is exposition cut against a derisory battle in the ruins of Osgilith. We have been here before and the return will lack the startling novelty of our first trip.  But put these doubts out of your mind. Do not think for one minute that Return Of The King fails to meet the considerable expectations that have grown up on the back of previous instalments. You could open an entire can of hyperbole over this film, and still run short of adjectives to praise its majesty. Still, let's try. No doubt there will be a few minor spoilers along the way.\u000aAfter mopping up the carnage at the close of the Two Towers, the various pieces of the chess game are moved into place for the mother-of-all-battles at the Gondorian stronghold of Minas Tirith. Pippin (Billy Boyd) is taken to the city by Gandalf after a ferocious encounter with a Palantir (a black crystal ball). This shocking, searing experience of sorcery heaves us on our way; the adventure resumes.   As the armies of Mordor approach, the palette darkens. Sam and Frodo exist under perpetual gloom, their pallors graying with hunger and exhaustion. Fatalism is in the air. As the fellowship embark upon their various missions, Merry admits "I just don't know what is going to happen". Legolas speaks of a "sleepless malice" rising against them. Even Gandalf admits that the odds are hopeless, death certain; "There was never much of a hope. Just a fool's hope."\u000aOverwhelmingly, this is a film about death. Not just in its bodycount (although the colossal battle scenes probably do set a new record for on-screen deaths, even if they are the killing of computer-generated hordes). The battles - whether it is the Nazgûls swooping over the carved citadel plucking soldiers from the battlements, or horses disappearing beneath the feet of charging oliphants - turn death into spectacle. But the speeches of Gandalf, and the friendship between Sam and Frodo turn that spectacle into something more telling. It is there in the reaction of the steward of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble), to the killing of his beloved son Boromir (Sean Bean, way back in the first film); the only character who loses control in the face of death. If these films have an overarching theme it is courage in the face of the insurmountable odds of your own mortality. Or as Aragorn puts it, as he leaps into an unknown, "I do not fear death". Or Gimli the dwarf, when regarding another suicidal mission; "Certainty of death? Small chance of success? What are we waiting for?"\u000aThe film is at its most moving when we are watching the fear play across the faces of our heroes, and the nameless ranks of men who stand against Sauron's horrors. Along with the high bodycount, there is a very high weepie count too, the sobs inspired as much by this bravery as by grief.\u000aOn a lighter note, the fans who have squirreled out sexual subtexts in the relationships between the hobbits as well as, say, Aragorn and Legolas, will find plenty of boxes to tick here. The Fellowship look longingly at one another. Also Aragorn, as he ascends to his birthright as King Of Gondor, single-handedly drags the patriarchal beard back into fashion.\u000aAlthough it is customary to praise the achievements of the special effects department, this trilogy's most startling achievement is its storytelling; every time the longeurs of exposition or the details of various races and myths threaten your suspension of disbelief, the three-handed scenes between Sam, Frodo and Gollum bring back intimacy and acuity of character. This focus tightens around the ring itself; the very small thing at the heart of this epic that stands for a very large theme. A small round band of gold that magnifies the evil in every heart and represents man's inexhaustible appetite for power.\u000aAgainst this ubiquitous evil stands man's improbable will to persist despite the monstrous nature of his condition; born to die, yet able to face this tragedy with courage and equanimity. As Gandalf puts it, "Death is just another path which we all must take." The greatest cinematic event of a generation is over, leaving behind it a thoughtful silence.\u000a

VAnother work of great imagination and beauty from Hiyao Miyazaki.

V\u000aHayao Miyazaki, the master of refined and (mostly) traditional animation, probably couldn't make a bad film. But with Howl's Moving Castle he fails to top his previous films, Princess Mononoke (1997) and the Oscar-winning Spirited Away (2001).\u000aAs with his 1986 film Castle In The Sky, Howl's Moving Castle is adapted from the work of Diana Wynne Jones, the British fantasy writer and onetime student of both JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis. Castle In The Sky is actually her sequel to Howl's Moving Castle, and both films are set in the same world: a land that resembles Europe around the turn of the 19th century. Here, industrialisation and technology are still picturesque. Side by side with this ordinary human society is a world of magic, which is more tangibly threatening than the new belching steam trains and cars.\u000aIn a city of Germanic, candy-coloured buildings lives Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer in the American dub), a shy, hardworking hat-maker. She's flung into an adventure - as Miyazaki's young heroines generally are - when she has a back alley encounter with Howl (Christian Bale), a notorious wizard who is reputed to eat the hearts of beautiful young women. He doesn't eat Sophie's heart; instead he sweeps her off as he's being pursued by mysterious shadowy creatures. These are the minions of the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall), a sometime employee of the royal court and former lover of Howl, who now has it in for him. Unluckily for Sophie, she's caught up in their battle and the Witch transforms her into an old woman (who is then voiced by Jean Simmons).\u000aWith consummate pragmatism, Sophie says to herself, "This isn't so bad. You're still in pretty good shape and your clothes finally suit you," then heads off alone into the Wastes. Here, she encounters another seemingly cursed entity, a mute scarecrow she dubs Turniphead. He leads her through the cold until she reaches the "moving castle" - a remarkable clanking construction that lumbers across the landscape thanks to the power of resident fire demon Calcifer (Billy Crystal). Sophie, with nowhere else to go, sets herself up as cleaner for Howl's household, which also includes a young apprentice (Josh Hutcherson). But as she grows used to her new body, and bonds grow between the members of this peculiar "family", a terrible mechanised warfare eats its way across the land and threatens the idyll.\u000aIt's a fabulous set-up, but unfortunately it lends itself to narrative convolutions that contrast with the immediacy of Spirited Away or Miyazaki's earlier films. The royal household, led by Howl's former mentor Suliman (Blythe Danner), is caught up in the war but it's never entirely clear who is fighting whom, or why. Perhaps this ambiguity is intentional, highlighting a sense of the futility of conflict. But as we see Howl, in the form of a giant flying bird, sweeping through fire-fights and battling other magical creatures, it's hard to fathom the implications. In one battle scene, the question arises: "Is it the enemy's or one of ours". The answer is, "What difference does it make?"\u000aAt its heart, the film is about Sophie discovering her true self, Howl discovering his, the Witch hers, and even Calcifer his. The whole thing is a jumble of journeys of self discovery set against Miyazaki's beautiful, evocative worlds.\u000aIn one scene the old Sophie, taking a break from her chores in the castle, sits beside a mountain lake, soaking in the scenery. The majesty of the mountains and the natural world is contrasted with the harshness of the society, where the seemingly benign combination of magic and industrialisation has collapsed into terrible destruction. There's doubtless a subtext here about the once agrarian Japan developing into the imperial, industrialised nation that felt atomic warfare firsthand. There are also themes relating to a more general disgust at the wastefulness of warfare, but again, it's not the film's greatest strength. That lies in the characterisation and, more so, in the characters' relationships with both themselves and each other.\u000aIn a nutshell: Another work of great imagination and beauty from Hiyao Miyazaki. More  muddled than his best films but charming and strangely profound.\u000aBy Daniel Etherington\u000a

VHulking great buildings, hulking men, hulking utterances are the blocks that Ridley Scott's film is constructed from. But at the heart of Gladiator's epic recreation of the ancient Roman world sits an effectively simple tale of loyalty and love. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a respected warrior, a general loyal to the visionary emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). However, when Marcus Aurelius dies, Maximus is double-crossed by the dangerous, nay deranged, new emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). All Maximus wants is to avenge his family. After being sold to gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed, serving up his final role with brute nobility), the experienced soldier fights his way up the gladiatorial league charts until he's the darling of the Colosseum. The David Beckham of bloodshed. Soon he gets a chance to face the father-murdering, sister-loving cause of his woes - Commodus. Ridley Scott's best film since Blade Runner, Gladiator magnificently revives a genre that seemed to have expired with Cleopatra in the mid-1960s. Although it's essentially cobbled together from 19th century neoclassical paintings, Spartacus and The Fall Of The Roman Empire, Gladiator is given added oomph with judiciously-applied CGI, a solid script from David Franzoni (Amistad), John Logan (The Aviator) and William Nicholson (Shadowlands). Plus, in Maximus, Russell Crowe found his best role. The supporting cast is impressive too.

VJames Ellroy's complex, multi-layered novel looked untranslatable to the screen. Director Curits Hanson and screenplay-writer Brian Helgeland simplified the story, stripping down the involved narrative, removing several sub-plots along the way, to create a slick, still-complex tale of Tinseltown sordidness that somehow remains completely faithful to the spirit of Ellroy.   The film is a procession of little miracles. Antipodeans Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe adopt faultless accents to play cops of varying moral rectitude. Crowe's tough guy Bud White falls hard for Kim Basinger's femme fatale, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Veronica Lake. The film is immersed in the real fantasy world of Hollywood, and the characters rub shoulders with movie stars and lookalike hookers.LA Confidential's most pleasant surprise is Basinger's defiantly well-modulated and poignant performance. Kevin Spacey is in fine form as crooked celebrity cop Jack Vincennes, a technical adviser to a popular TV show. Rather than doing his accustomed job of scene-stealing, he is just another top-drawer performer in a uniformly strong cast.   Curtis Hanson successfully made the transition from being a reliable director of formula thrillers to expertly holding together a labyrinthine plot. Ellroy was said to have been delighted with the film. Kenneth Anger, the chronicler of Hollywood sleaze, must have loved it too.

VThe astounding commercial success of Spielberg's theme-park movie proved once again the power of marketing and awesome special effects to overcome a thin story line and feeble characterisation. Another surprising aspect of the response was that the film seemed not to depend on a decent-sized cinema screen but proved effective when reduced to little brother telly. A definite tribute to the director's manipulative skill in dotting the overlong proceedings with enough shocks, scary moments and sentimentality to take up the slack.   Amid the special effects showcasing and chases, Jurassic Park exhibits the perennial concerns of Michael Crichton - who wrote the source novel. Said concern is man abusing scientific knowledge and playing God. The culprit here is Attenborough's John Hammond, an entrepreneur who has used dinosaur DNA taken from blood-sucking mosquitoes that have been preserved in amber to re-create the prehistoric dinosaurs, with the intention of opening the ultimate theme-park cum nature reserve. To prove that all is well with his proposed park, Hammond is forced to call in three 'experts': paleontologist Dr Alan Grant (Neill), his girlfriend paleo-botanist Dr Ellie Sattler (Dern), and chaos theoretician Dr Ian Malcolm (Goldblum). Oh, and sadly some kids are along for the ride too - they are the target audience after all, both for Hammond and for Spielberg.After the initial splendour of viewing a brontosaurus chomping on a tree-top and the thrill of cuddling a sickly tricerotops, things inevitably go sour and the predators make their presence felt. T-Rex reestablishes his reign, this time as king of movie monsters (a kind of bipedal Jaws), while the smaller velociraptors prove their viciousness by hunting and chowing down on various cast members. Much of the film consists of being chased by dinosaurs and trying to survive. It's a simple formula, but crudely effective.  Attenborough is preposterously bad as Hammond, with an accent as wobbly as his scientific and moral judgement; the performance is only redeemed by his twinkly eyes. The rest of the cast are adequate, but hobbled by under-developed characters. Possibly the rather characterless leads work to the movie's advantage, since no one going to see a dazzling special effects movie needs distracting by a tame scientist's view of very untamed monsters. Not surprisingly, the sound and the computer-generated visuals received Oscars.

The attention to minute details gives it a rich texture; there are some fantastic set-pieces (Leia's rescue from the Death Star, the X-Wing dogfights), and Lucas binds the whole film together with a hokey religion (The Force) and fatalistic story lifted from Greek mythology. While Ford famously dismissed the script (complaining that, "You can type this shit, but you can't say it"), Lucas manages to get away with it by making everyone take it seriously - although Ford can often be seen smirking his way through some of the more clunky lines. Then there's the rousing score by John Williams.\u000a

VRent this film now on Film4oD\u000aOr rent other films that stand the test of time now on Film4oD\u000a \u000aCameron came to this low-budget science fiction movie with a single directorial credit to his name, the silly exploitation film Piranha II: The Spawning. The best that Schwarzenegger could boast from his screen career was a touching turn in Stay Hungry and an attention-grabbing appearance in the body-building documentary Pumping Iron. Both would go on to bigger things, but none that would equal the imagination or vigour of this frenetic thriller. Already Cameron's favourite themes are evident in this taut, economical tale of the duel between a killer robot (Schwarzenegger) and his human nemesis, Reese (Biehn), over Sarah Connor, the woman (Hamilton) whose unborn child will in the 21st century save humanity by destroying the machines that have taken over the world. In Cameron's films it is always the women who are the natural leaders, the survivors. Also, from a director who is famously in love with technology, the film is obsessively technophobic. The secret of its success is certainly not in its originality - science fiction author Harlan Ellison threatened legal action until he was awarded a writing credit - but lies in its relentless energy, and Schwarzenegger himself as the taciturn monster, who in the course of the action delivers fewer than 100 words of dialogue.

VCrisco, a colourless, unctuously smooth brand of vegetable shortening that's a mainstay in kitchens across the United States, is a true wonder product - as useful for removing eye bags as it is for crisping up fried chicken. So we are told in one scene of The Help, actor-turned-director Tate Taylor's blandly enjoyable adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's Civil Rights-themed bestseller, and there's little reason to doubt this endorsement: the entire film appears to have been made of the stuff.\u000aAs lily-white a tale of the black experience as could imaginably be put to screen in the 21st century, Taylor's polished period piece raises something of an if-a-tree-falls-in-the-forest question: if the story of the publication of a landmark book, one that changed attitudes to race relations in an especially bigoted corner of the Deep South, never really happened, what does it ultimately signify? If the film inevitably inherits the unearned self-importance of Stockett's novel, however, it remains a hearty and stirring fiction, its over-ironed social and moral landscape lent feeling and texture by a busily stranded narrative and some empathetic performances that elegantly separate the human truths from the screenplay's homilies.\u000aChief among these is Viola Davis, deservedly a dead cert for Oscar recognition in 2012: as written, the relentlessly stoic, noble Aibileen should be a scarcely penetrable stereotype, yet she becomes bruised flesh and blood through Davis's rich line readings and creased body language.\u000aThe rest of the ensemble is a mixed bag, ranging from the wonderful Jessica Chastain, as a guilelessly liberal trophy wife, to the overly panto-ready Bryce Dallas Howard, as the queen bee of the oppressors - with a disappointingly de-amped Emma Stone, as our mostly symbolic protagonist, somewhere in between. If you find your eyes getting annoyingly moist at points of this airbrushed but effective heartwarmer, give the bulk of the credit (or blame) to Davis, and try a little Crisco.

VIn lieu of waiting around forever for Mr Right, single 30-something Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) has IVF treatment in order to have a baby. But when she meets the possible man of her dreams on the way out of the clinic, can they fit a relationship around her burgeoning bump?\u000a																\u000a																The Back-up Plan is one of those rom-coms that claims to grapple with the issues facing the modern woman. Despite being marketed at a broad mainstream audience, it's hard to believe that successful single career women having IVF in order to become a one parent family is a situation that resonates with very many women, even today. Minority topic or not, it's a subject that arguably merits exploration, perhaps in a drama, or over the span of time afforded by a television series - but not much about it screams 'J-Lo comedy vehicle'.\u000a																\u000a																Of course, we and Miss Lopez are not really here to explore the issues - The Back-up plan is simply an excuse to gamely stake out a succession of weak jokes on the groundbreaking new comic territory of pregnant women's hormones, their insatiable cravings and, horror of horrors, not fitting into their old clothes (stop the hilarity, you're killing me). The first half hour, in which we meet Zoe, Zoe's faintly irritating friends, and come to terms with the fact that she has a disabled dog as a comic foil, feels like a pilot for a sit-com. The remainder of the 110 minute run-time feels like the other episodes in that hypothetical series compressed into an unending, unendurable laugh-free soap opera.\u000a																\u000a																It's a film that raises the larger question of why we're seeing vehicles for high profile female stars, written by women, that nevertheless manage to be intensely patronising towards women (see also:The Bounty Hunter, Motherhood). Perhaps changes are made to the scripts by studios, or perhaps the writers themselves have sold out. Some commentators saw Kathryn Bigelow's victory as the first female director to win a Best Director Oscar as a hollow one, given her CV is dominated by films involving predominantly male characters, but if it means she can avoid directing cynical female-focussed clap-trap like The Back-up Plan, we can only endorse her approach.\u000a

VIn Stanley Kubrick's Gothic chiller aspiring-writer Jack Torrance (Nicholson) accepts a job as a caretaker at the Overlook Hotel during an icy Oregon winter so he can write his book. But the hotel has a macabre history that soon begins to worm its way into the present through the medium of his psychic son, Danny (Lloyd).   Elegantly disturbing images ensue as Jack's writer's block gives way to derangment and his son sensitivity to the paranormal peels back the layers of history.Unlike horror films which identify the terror externally - as a monster or pursuing entity - The Shining locates the horror firmly within the family. The threat of violence within the domestic space is somehow even scarier than the Grand Guignol of the ghosts in the ballroom and blood in the bath.  As always, Kubrick dwells on the stylistic details, the use of steady-cam, and grand location and the cinematography, and the film is drenched with atmosphere. Shelley Duvall contorts and screams up a stunning display of gruesome fear as Jack's terrified wife, Wendy. And Jack Nicholson's performance is, of course, unforgettably deranged.

VThere has never been an adequate explanation as to why this superb gangster epic didn't win 1990's Best Picture Academy Award. And why a film featuring 20 minutes of buffaloes stampeding and Kevin Costner with a 'tache (Dances With Wolves) was considered more worthy than one that featured Joe Pesci's memorable "How the fuck am I funny?" tirade is anyone's guess.   Glaring goofs by the Academy aside, GoodFellas is one of the best gangster movies ever. The tale of 30 years of life in the Mob, as seen through the eyes of real-life gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), was based on Nicholas Pileggi's gripping book (which he and Martin Scorsese adapted for the screen) and directed with skill by Scorsese.  There are so many things about this movie that are great - the casting of Robert De Niro as Hill's mentor and Pesci (who won an Oscar) as the psychotic Tommy, that infamous tracking shot as Henry and his date (Lorraine Bracco) walk into the Copacabana restaurant, the soundtrack featuring everything from Tony Bennett to The Who - it's no real surprise that the movie regularly appears on critics' Top Ten lists. Gripping, beautifully written, brilliantly directed, funny and tragic all in one - it certainly deserves to be right up there.

VFans of the cinema of Walter Salles (Central Station) will have had a cinematic initiation into the reality of Brazil's poor communities. But where only half of the action in Midnight, the 1998 film co-directed by Salles, took viewers into the favelas (slums) of Rio De Janeiro, City Of God (which Salles co-produced) never leaves them. It's entire narrative is saturated with the desperation and violence of Brazil's disenfranchised underclass.\u000a																\u000a																Between 1986 and 1996, writer Paolo Lins researched the drug trade within the ironically named Cidade De Dues (City Of God), a 1960s housing project where he grew up. The novel, and the fact it was based in, was potent raw material for a film. Screenwriter Bráulio Mantovani, director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Katia Lund have done a remarkable job of bringing this marginalised history and culture of violence to the screen. Meirelles talks of "a movie which was true to the book: filmed from the inside of the favela out." To achieve this fidelity, the filmmakers auditioned 2,000 kids from the favelas, took 200 on to acting workshops, then improvised the scenes, free of marks, continuity control or any of the formal filmmaking strictures.\u000a																Although the subject of the film is Cidade De Dues itself, the narrative is structured around Rocket, or Buscapé in the Portuguese (played by Luis Otavio as a kid in the 1960s, by Alexandre Rodrigues in the film's 1970s and 1980s segments). A 1960s slum kid, he observes his friends and peers opting for the gun-obsessed life of crime. As young Li'l Dice, or Dadinho, (Douglas Silva) says, "We need to rob some rich guy's house, it's the only way out of here." Rocket, however, hangs back from the endemic violence the other kids accept so readily. As his older brother tells him shortly before being shot dead by Li'l Dice, "I'm a hood 'cos I've got no brain. But you're smart. You should study." Despite the lack of opportunities, Rocket aspires to be a photographer.\u000a																\u000a																In the 1970s, Li'l Dice has become Li'l Zé (Leandro Firmino Da Hora), a remorseless hood who kills his way to the top of the heap by murdering all the drug gang leaders ("At 18, he was the most respected hood in Rio De Janero"). Although Rocket wants to avenge his brother, he also wants to stay out of trouble. Amazingly, his career as a journalist is kicked off by accident when Zé forces him to photograph him and his gang armed to the teeth and the picture ends up on the front of the paper. Zé's violent aspirations are spinning out of control, and when he rapes the girlfriend of bus-fare collector and ex-soldier Knockout Ned (Jorge), and kills his brother and uncle, the previously peaceable Ned joins up with gangster Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele) and goes on the warpath. Every act of vengeance generates another however, and soon the favela is a war-zone.\u000a																With its epic, three time period story of young men making their way, violently, in a life of crime, City Of God is like a Brazilian underclass GoodFellas. But with its quintessential new-Latin-cinema energy, dynamic shooting style and complex structure of interconnected stories, it's also comparable to the Mexican Amores Perros.  Although the film is too heavily reliant on voice-over from Rocket ("The ghetto had been a purgatory, now it was a hell"), otherwise it is a fascinating, powerful film, full up with angry power about the disgraceful state of Brazil urban poverty, and how it simply creates a culture of desperate greed and cyclical violence.

V\u000aWith the second instalment of the Mafia trilogy, Francis Ford Coppola  weaves the characters from The Godfather into a deeply personal film  that betters the original for pathos and sheer epic grandeur. The film follows Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he attempts to consolidate his power and achieve respectability as the new head of the Corleone crime family. However, the strains of a government investigation and an assassination attempt on his life begin to fracture his world.\u000aThis sequel focuses on Michael's relationship with his nervous brother Fredo (John Cazale). Michael knows Fredo was involved in the assassination plot and Coppola adds depth to our understanding of this conflict (and its consequences) by telling Michael's story in tandem with that of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro). From Vito escaping Sicily as a boy to the humble origins of the Corleone family in America, these scenes show the traditions and codes of honour that Michael has gradually lost sight of as an adult.\u000a"If anything in this life is certain, it's that we can kill anyone," he says at one point. He's talking about his enemy, Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), but really he's justifying in his own mind his plan to kill Fredo. Amid the sumptuous set-pieces and bombastic scenes that have rightly become a part of cinema history, it's a subtle moment, indicating the extent to which Michael has abandoned the values instilled in him by his father.\u000aNever go against the family, was Marlon Brando's mantra in the original. But by killing Fredo, fighting with his wife (Diane Keaton) and freezing out half-brother Tom Hagan (Robert Duvall), Michael does just that. The final shot of Pacino, alone and reflective, is one of a man in purgatory. This is beautiful and haunting stuff.\u000aIn a nutshell: A multi-generational epic that never leaves the audience less than enthralled, this is the godfather of all gangster films.\u000a\u000a

Keaton changed the way a generation talked and dressed (can we ever forgive her for the manly suits and that annoying hat?) with her portrayal of ditsy Annie, but it is Allen's observant and funny one-liners that remain in your head ('don't knock masturbation, it's sex with someone I love') well after the credits have rolled.\u000a																\u000a																Both warm and witty, this is also notable for some future stars popping up in minor roles: watch for Jeff Goldblum (who gets to mutter 'I forgot my mantra!'), former Charlie's Angel Shelley Hack, and, at the end of the movie, Sigourney Weaver as Alvy's date.

VAs 20-year-old Shino (Kawaguchi) is first harassed, then threatened with a knife, bound with rope and sexually molested by drunken Eisuke (Sato) in the house where she works as maid, she does not scream and seems strangely resigned to her fate - even when Eisuke, passing a mirror, declares his murderous intentions with the words: "This'll be our last reflection together."\u000a																\u000a																Eisuke is mistaken. Interrupted in his assault on Shino, he instead rapes and murders the mistress of the house before fleeing into the daylight and Shino lives to see another day. In fact Shino knows Eisuke well from her past, and immediately writes to his wife, the schoolteacher Matsuko (Koyama), to denounce Eisuke's crimes - but both women choose to withhold the true identity of the serial 'phantom killer' from the investigating police inspector (Watanabe), even as more violent crimes are committed.\u000a																\u000a																A mosaic of flashbacks offers a long 'reflection' on the ties that bind together Shino, Eisuke, Matsuko and the suicide of Genji (Toura), all from the same Shinshu village, and each embodying the extremes of a nation's idealism and disillusionment, humanity and bestiality, death and survival. As Eisuke continues his compulsive onslaught through the cities of Japan, it emerges that Shino and Matsuko are themselves trapped in their own repeating cycles of complicity, guilt and despair, all going back to the catastrophic collapse, several years earlier, of a collective farm on which the four had worked together.\u000a																If Nagisa Oshima's Night And Fog In Japan (1960), with its jaundiced view of progress, showed the first ripples of the Japanese New Wave, then the similarly themed Violence At High Noon, made just six years later, was a veritable tsunami of innovations in cinematic expression. \u000a																\u000a																Both films feature state-of-the-nation plots that unravel through a complicated series of flashbacks and repetitions, and both films deal with political disillusionment and the eternal return of the past. But where Night And Fog was dominated by the sort of long sequence shots that typified the classical cinema of Mizoguchi or Ozu, the narrative of Violence At High Noon is slashed and fractured, whether through the compulsive restlessness of Keiichi Uraoka's editing or the delirious mobility of Akira Takada's Cinemascope camerawork.\u000a																\u000a																It is as though Eisuke's neurotic tension has infected the whole world, in a film that is dissecting the pathology of a nation as much as of any individual. Cruel, drunken Eisuke holds up a mirror to the aggression, rapacity, misogyny and inhumanity within a society still coming to terms with both its brutal wartime conduct and its rapid post-war transition to Western-style capitalism (with all of the political compromise that such a transition entails) - and it is a mirror in which Shino, Matsuko and Eisuke all see themselves uncomfortably reflected.\u000a																\u000a																If the past and present look bleak in Violence At High Noon, there is not much more hope for the future either. Shino, the youngest member of the original collective farm, is last seen literally biting through a rope that binds her to another character as though she were cutting an umbilical cord - but her earlier attempts to be 'reborn' and to sever her links to the past have all ended up bringing her right back to where she started, leading her at one point to declare, "I'll never be free". The best that can be said for her prospects is that she is a natural survivor (several times over).Meanwhile the next generation, as embodied by Matsuko's young school pupils, may well turn out to be just like Eisuke (who after all was himself once a pupil of Matsuko's), and they are last glimpsed standing confused in the middle of an imposing modern city where a distraught Matsuko has suddenly abandoned them with the words, "I wish you all good luck." Oshima's film is mostly set, as its title implies, in broad daylight, but there is little brightness to be found in its message about a Japan that moves swiftly forwards but never really changes.\u000a																\u000a																Violence At High Noon may be based loosely on the real-life case of a serial rapist and murderer who was protected by his own wife and a surviving victim, but it no more resembles a conventional psychothriller than Shohei Imamura's similarly reality-based Vengeance Is Mine (1979) would a decade later. \u000a																\u000a																Any police procedural takes place entirely at the film's periphery, with the focus very much on the two women who must (and yet cannot) resolve their ambivalent feelings towards a violent criminal, and towards a past that binds them. It might almost be a melodrama, save for all the political allegory, as Oshima asks how a seemingly civilised society can create and knowingly harbour a monster within.\u000a																\u000a																The high contrast black-and-white photography looks incredible, the performances (especially Sato's menacing swagger) are excellent - but where the film will fall down, at least for today's audiences, is in the inscrutability of its characters' motivations. At various points, both Shino and Matsuko declare that no one will understand the way they feel, and many viewers will be left in perplexed agreement. As an exercise in New Wave stylings, Violence At High Noon is impeccable, but as an engaging, cogent story, it falls short. Perhaps that is inevitable in a film whose principal themes are alienation, disorientation and endless diabolical repetition.

He's exquistely dressed and buffed to perfection, his appearance representing his values. Well, superficially. When he dons an apron and selects a large kitchen knife his inner identity comes to the fore.\u000a																\u000a																Where the novel was exquisitely sick, the film version necessarily skips over Bateman's more creative ways of dispatching his victims, and his fantasies. Arguably, this glosses over Ellis' finer points. Harron, who also co-scripted with Guinevere Turner, instead incorporates a fine element of slapstick in lieu of Ellis' more literal stomanch-churning descriptions (so no face-drilling; instead we're treated to the sight of Bale chasing a victim with a chainsaw). Plus, there's the running joke of Bateman admitting to his proclivities in conversation - but as everyone is equally self obsessed, they don't listen and no one hears ("I'm into murders and executions" he declares of his professional concerns).\u000a																A glimpse of the book's more elaborate satire also shines, though. Bateman's lecture on the superiority of Genesis with Phil Collins as opposed to Peter Gabriel is enough to make anyone scream in absolute terror.

VThis is the kind of review where what we really need is a flowchart. Have you seen John Carpenters 1982 The Thing? No? Proceed directly to paragraph two. You have? Ok, so heres the deal. This film is a sort-of prequel, sort-of remake, sort-of inspired-by beastie that borrows many of the 1982 versions aesthetic choices and basic conceits. Just as the monster of the title takes a unique organic original and seeks to replicate it sufficiently well that it can pass as the same type of thing in the eyes of the unwary, so this remake is both The Thing, and also not The Thing, but a deceptive copy.\u000aTaken on its own terms, this film provides some reasonably effective monster movie fun. If you have a friend who jumps easily at horror movies, theyll be jumping at several points here. (Whether these jumps are all earned by the filmmakers, or more a result of suddenly ramping the volume up on a sudden visual cue is a question for more seasoned horror hounds.) The filmmakers also introduce a language barrier between various characters, further exacerbating the paranoia and tension that is a hallmark of any isolated who-dunnit. Or in this case, who-is-it.\u000aUltimately what lets the 2011 incarnation of The Thing down somewhat is its state-of-the-art effects. Which is ironic, when you consider that the practical latex and corn-syrup effects are one of the crowning joys of the 1982 version created almost 30 years ago. Its de rigeur amongst film critics to carp about CGI, but here, some moaning is justified, precisely because they use CGI very effectively in some scenes, but ridiculously in others. There are moments in this film that represent the best of what CGI can accomplish and others where the sense that youre looking at a computer image overwhelms what should be the horror of the situation. This team know how to do good CGI, why cant they tell the difference?

VMarvel's finest heroes finally come together to set a comic book franchise gold standard that will take some beating.
p124
sg4
V\u000aAs a concept, Avengers Assemble was a huge creative gamble and potential disaster. Multiple characters drawn together from multiple films, each with their own fairly specific vibe and an A-list actor to boot? Surely it couldn\u2019t be anything other than a frustrating patchwork of egos competing for screentime? Luckily, Marvel entrusted this particular roll of the dice to Joss Whedon, a writer-director known for his deft handling of character and his ability to judge exactly when to undercut pomp with humour and when to bring on the emotion, developed while overseeing several hundred hours of ensemble-based supernatural television.\u000aWhedon\u2019s Avengers Assemble is almost improbably good, considering the possible pitfalls. Enjoyable enough in terms of sheer adrenaline, where it really comes into its own is in how satisfying the whole thing is emotionally. It\u2019s such a huge relief as a cinemagoer to be able to revel in a film like this without having to switch off your brain or check your critical faculties at the door (or worse, being told that disliking - say - a Transformers movie is somehow a failing on your part, because you didn\u2019t dumb yourself down enough in advance before watching, and what did you expect?). \u000aIn contrast, if you watch Avengers without your brain engaged, you\u2019ll still have a pretty good time, but you\u2019ll also miss out, since this is filmmaking as smart as it is colourful and exciting. Smart yes, dark, no - Avengers Assemble is also bright and funny, skilfully sidestepping the nihilism fallacy, which seeks to suggest comic book movies are somehow more valid when they\u2019re \u201cdark\u201d.\u000aIf Avengers Assemble has a weakness, it lies not with any of the principals, but with what they\u2019re up against. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is of course absurdly brilliant, bringing the King Lear b-plot of embittered illegitimate sibling sharply into focus, giving Thor a personal angle on an earthbound conflict from which he might otherwise have felt distanced - what with being a god from another world and all. \u000aIt\u2019s just a slight shame the MacGuffin Loki has to work with is a magical space cube that threatens to unleash forgettable hordes of reptilian chaps visually recalling Doctor Who\u2019s Silurians. Oh well. It\u2019s not like we really recall the individual mooks The Joker unleashed against Batman, either. And it\u2019s certainly refreshing to find the focus here firmly on the heroes, in a genre which is always in danger of being seduced by the villains. You certainly can\u2019t accuse the lizard chaps of glamorizing the way of the mook.\u000a \u000a

VSensitive fable about Victorian England's most renowned "freak" from David Lynch. Black and white widescreen provides a sumptuous backdrop to excellent turns from a youthful Anthony Hopkins and an unrecognisable John Hurt. \u000a\u000a																In unsympathetic Victorian England, John Merrick (Hurt) has been abused since childhood and forced into a freakshow because of his appalling deformity. Frederick Treves (Hopkins), a surgeon at the London Hospital, removes Merrick from the dingy sideshow and treats his bronchitis. Although Treves initially thinks - hopes - Merrick is no more than an imbecile and exhibits him to his fellow doctors, he is essentially a more humane keeper than Bytes (Jones), the drunk who had presented Merrick in the freakshow. \u000a																Posh London society replaces the sideshow punters, and Merrick is essentially still on display. This worsens when the hosptial night porter (Elphick) starts showing Merrick off to his drunken pub mates by night.\u000a																However, while Merrick is in the care of Treves, he is treated well, both physically and psychologically, and reveals a sensitivity and intelligence that had been missed by those who do not see beyond appearances. He even experiences friendship and respect.\u000a																David Lynch's The Elephant Man raises myriad questions about medicine, the notion of vainglory and society's prejudices and asks us to wonder whether, over a century later, matters have improved.\u000a																\u000a																What astonishes most is the compassion of Lynch's direction, something not echoed widely in his other films. The greatest contribution - apart from the central performances - comes from Francis, whose wonderful black and white, widescreen photography lends atmosphere and clarity to the proceedings.

V\u000aWhether your image of jazz is gleaned from Derek 'Spinal Tap' Smalls and his endless, aimless "jazz odyssey" or it brings to mind the cringeworthy blackface of Neil Diamond in The Jazz Singer, it's probably fair to say that the musical genre doesn't translate particularly well to film. Whiplash is different, because in Damien Chazelle's breakneck drummer drama, the music itself is almost incidental. It's a near flawless movie about the human condition and our drive for perfection: the obsession in question \u2013 jazz drumming \u2013 is unimportant. Thankfully, it just so happens that the soundtrack is tremendous, whether you enjoy jazz or merely tolerate it from the other side of walls.\u000aWe open on a long shot of college kid Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), playing drums to an audience of one. As Chazelle's camera slowly draws down the corridor, we can see the look of determination on Andrew's face, the speed of his reactions, the sweat on his brow. Neyman's audience doubles thanks to the appearance of near-mythical jazz teacher Fletcher (JK Simmons), and even though he's nonchalantly chewed out with roughly the same manners a dog affords a slipper, our young protagonist is flushed with reason anew to bang those drums. There on in, Chazelle gives an insight into what it means to want something so bad you're willing to be pushed to the brink of insanity to get it.\u000aWhiplash is decked with outstanding performances from both Teller and Simmons. Teller starts the movie playing a lump of clay and ends it as if carved out of stone, literally shedding blood, sweat and tears in the transformation. It feels like a watershed role for Teller, so far dramatically untested by the likes of Footloose and Zac Efron romantic comedies, but utterly lost in craft here; you feel every ounce of determination shared between actor and character. Conversely, Simmons creates a memorable menace with minimal effort; a monstrous motivator not above trying to decapitate his students if they're unable to keep pace ("There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'," he growls). The movie doesn't work without heat between teacher and student, but Teller and Simmons strike fire \u2013 they make for an abusive relationship but hell if they don't make beautiful music together.\u000aAnd oh, that music \u2013 sublime soul music custom-built to get you moving. Here's a trick: when watching Whiplash with a friend who claims to hate jazz, glance down at their feet and I guarantee that come the movie's triumphant final scene \u2013 the cinematic equivalent of punching the air \u2013 said friend will be spasmodically tapping their feet to something approaching the beat. Even those allergic to turbo-charged tempos will find something to love: with drama taut as a drum and a head-on collision of two unflinching performances, Whiplash is car-crash cinema of the most wonderful kind.\u000aIn a nutshell: Judged on its own merits, Whiplash is superb: slick, authentic and infectious. Factor in a first-time director who's under 30 and it's an achievement that borders on the obscene.\u000aBy Ali Gray\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000aAs a stress-inducing exercise in cinematic asphyxiation, Whiplash is this year\u2019s Gravity. Where Alfonso Cuarón\u2019s film placed an astronaut into merciless space, writer-director Damien Chazelle chucks 19-year-old jazz drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) into the merciless grasp of a brutal music instructor (JK Simmons). And just like Gravity, Whiplash is bound for Oscars.\u000aTeller\u2019s performance transcends his previous roles, infusing Andrew with natural innocence slowly warped by a necessary arrogance as he seeks to \u201cbe the best\u201d. This passion drives him, but also traps him in the torturous tutelage of Fletcher, played by the brilliantly frightening Simmons. Andrew wants to please Fletcher, but Fletcher keeps the bar drastically out of reach by implementing physical and psychological cruelty that is not only sickening, it\u2019s calculated \u2013 a method he\u2019s refined to an abusive art-form. The tension comes from how far Andrew is willing to stretch himself to get to that impossible bar, and whether or not he\u2019ll snap in the process.\u000aAdding elements of claustrophobia to Fletcher\u2019s fearful classroom, Chazelle confines his shots to confronting close-ups and superb macro-photography of sweat-covered cymbals and Andrew\u2019s bleeding hands. Outside of practice, the filmmaking simplifies, creating a contrasting sense of ease.\u000aA rigid subset of audiences may not accept the plausibility of the scenarios (again, like Gravity), but those who submit to the film will be treated to a masterful finale that stills the lungs and silences the mind.

V\u000aThe wisdom of shooting all three The Lord Of The Rings films back-to-back becomes immediately apparent as you settle into The Two Towers. The continuity is so smooth you could be picking up a book you put aside a year earlier. On the return to Middle-earth, we find it darker, heavier, with a plot that forks along three paths, and as such is more satisfying than the linear fight-march-fight-march of The Fellowship Of The Ring.\u000aOn their quest to Mordor, hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) encounter the stinking Gollum (Andy Serkis), whose soul has been twisted and divided by the malign aura of the Ring. The tale demands and gets a substantial performance from this new character, conjured out of CGI and voiced superbly by Serkis (who also performed the role on set as a guide for the animators). Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) are helping the people of Rohan prepare for an assault by the forces of evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). Having just escaped their Uruk-hai captors, the third part of the fellowship, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), hang out up an ancient living tree, called Treebeard (voiced by Rhys-Davies).\u000aOut of these three strands, it is the troubles of Rohan that dominate our attention, as King Théoden (Bernard Hill) moves his people to the mountain fortress of Helm's Deep, where soon over 10,000 of Saruman's monstrous Uruk-hai warriors and other hideous Orcs will lay siege, providing the epic battle that closes the film.\u000aWhile many contemporary blockbusters leave a stink in your skull, as if an entire marketing department has dumped in your brain, The Lord Of The Rings films have been crafted by Peter Jackson as works of integrity that deepen as they unfold. The Fellowship Of The Ring was impressive, but it could not be accused of profundity. The Two Towers is genuinely moving, however. The courage of King Théoden and his followers in the battle of Helm's Deep, the women and children cowering in the caves as the Uruks stamp and bellow outside, will swell your tear ducts.\u000aJackson has also added welcome comic moments to this dark tale, most of them coming from dwarf Gimli, who at one point has to be tossed into battle. His repartee with elf Legolas is warming up nicely; having run for three days and three nights in pursuit of the Uruk-hai who have taken Merry and Pippin, he mutters "Dwarves are wasted on cross-country, we're natural sprinters you know". Also, the Orcs have now got cockney accents, a great touch.\u000aAlso, where Fellowship Of The Ring was glorious but felt strangely irrelevant, sealed off in its own little world, The Two Towers connects with the present day, and not merely because of its unfortunate title. Tolkien's concerns with industrialisation sweeping away the old rural life are also more apparent here. Saruman says "the old world shall burn in the fire of industry". Also, the tree people, the ancient Ents, are stirred from their indifference by the destruction of their woodland ("There is no curse in Elfish, Entish or all the tongues of man for this treachery," he says when faced by the wasteland Saruman has created from a once great forest). Essentially, the war of Middle-earth is a struggle of diverse peoples to survive under the cosh of mass production, a theme that inspires long after the special effects have faded from view.\u000a

V\u000aAfter the gothic monster-movie in space that was Ridley Scott's seminal masterpiece Alien, James Cameron had the bright idea of subtly shifting genre for the sequel. The result, Aliens, re-casts the Vietnam-style war drama in deep space, having taken a heavy cue from Robert Heinlein's novel 'Starship Troopers' (itself later adapted by Paul Verhoeven). Sigourney Weaver reprises the role of intergalactic extra-terrestrial basher Ellen Ripley. Picking up from where Alien left off - with Ripley the sole survivor of the crew of the Nostromo - Aliens takes us back to 'LV-426', the planet where the chain of events had started.\u000aContact has been lost with the terraforming colony there, so the Colonial Marines (a gung-ho bunch) are sent in to investigate, with Ripley as a "consultant". Inevitably, Ripley ends up taking control, battling hordes of the nasty 'xenomorphs', which have bred using the unsuspecting colonists as incubators. A genuinely exhilarating, exhausting experience, Aliens leaps from one edge-of-the-seat setpiece to another with barely a pause for breath (just when you think it's all over it manages to pull another horrifying surprise out of the bag). It even manages to squeeze in a human angle in the shape of the planet's sole survivor, the orphaned pre-teen Newt (Henn), whom Ripley rescues and protects throughout, creating a kind of curiously poignant mother-daughter bond that not only gives more of an insight into the true character of our butt-kicking heroine but also acts as an interesting contrast to the movie's main monster foe - the mother of all the nasty vicious critters, the giant-sized Alien Queen.\u000a \u000a

VThere is no definitive Batman. \u000a																\u000a																Bob Kane's character, created way back in the late 1930s, has been through the hands of innumerable creative talents for his adventures in comic books, on TV and in feature films. Some of these focus on the caped crime fighter's capacity as a detective, some on his activities as a violent vigilante, while others just fixated on his codpiece. \u000a																\u000a																Remember Batman Forever (the one with Jim Carrey as The Riddler) and Batman & Robin) (the one with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze)? It was these camp incarnations that killed off Warner Brothers' once lucrative superhero franchise in 1997. Having started strongly with Tim Burton's dark fairytale vision of Batman, the superhero became a soft-drink peddling, Day-Glo nightmare in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. Subsequent to these official Warners films, there was an unofficial live action short - 2003's Batman: Dead End - which for many fans was the finest cinematic evocation of the character yet. \u000a																\u000a																With this history in mind, the big challenge for Warners (owners of DC Comics, the home of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman etc) was to put some credibility back into Batman, satisfying both fans and the wider audience for summer blockbusters. In the years following Batman & Robin, there were several aborted reinventions; first Kevin Smith (Clerks) then Wolfgang Peterson (The Perfect Storm) were attached to Superman Vs Batman; abrasive arthouse talent Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For A Dream) was lined-up to adapt Frank Miller's and David Mazzuchelli's essential 1987 graphic novel 'Batman: Year One', a sober prequel to the former's 1986 landmark title 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'. Warners were clearly taking the character very seriously. The considerable thought and attention of this production history pays off in Batman Begins.\u000a																The action starts in an east Asian prison, where Bruce Wayne (Bale) is "exploring the criminal fraternity" according to a dapper, mysterious figure (Neeson) who appears and offers him a way out. He says he can give Wayne a chance to "devote yourself to an ideal". This suits Wayne, who "seeks a means to fight injustice, to turn fear upon those who prey on the fearful." Why is he so driven? Because, as we're shown in flashbacks, his childhood was destroyed by the slaying of his philanthropic parents (Roach and Stewart) by a random mugger in a Gotham City back alley. \u000a																\u000a																Neeson's character, who calls himself Ducard, mentors Wayne, a man driven by anger but also naive and undisciplined. Ducard is involved with the League Of Shadows, a kind of Templar / Illuminati organisation that has worked as "a check against human corruption for thousands of years". Neeson gets a bit Jedi while recruiting Wayne, telling him, "Your anger gives you great power, but if you let it, it will destroy you". The training strengthens Wayne, hones his skills and philosophies. "To conquer fear you must become fear," Ducard tells him. And what is our hero most afraid of? Bats, after an encounter with them in childhood left him terrified and troubled by recurrent nightmares.\u000a																When Wayne finally returns to Gotham, to his family home and avuncular butler Alfred (Caine), he finds the city in a terrible state. According to Rachel (Holmes), a childhood friend of Wayne's who's now assistant district attorney, "this city is rotting", because of gang lord Falcone (an oddly cast Wilkinson) who "keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared".\u000a																\u000a																With his new-found sense of purpose, Wayne vows to transform the city. But he won't be able to do it alone. One of the more considered elements of the film is how Wayne could realistically (well, realistically-ish) become Batman. Here, he amasses his arsenal, costume, kit and vehicle through his connections with his father's company, Wayne Enterprises. A former friend of his father, Lucius Fox (Freeman), has been buried in the Applied Sciences Division by the corporate-minded CEO Richard Earle (Hauer). It's through Fox that Wayne acquires his remarkable body armour, surveillance equipment and kit for enabling him to negotiate the alleys and rooftops of Gotham. Wayne also makes a connection with detective Jim Gordon (Oldman), one of the only straight cops in the Gotham police.\u000a																Like Richard Donner's Superman and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, Batman Begins has two distinct halves. We get the story of the hero's origins, then his first big adventure. It's a slightly awkward blend, breaking the classical three act structure, and Nolan doesn't pull it off entirely gracefully. Indeed, things get a bit silly in the second half with novelty bad guys (Cillian Murphy's Dr Jonathan Crane aka The Scarecrow), and a plot involving a stolen microwave emitter and "weaponised hallucinogens". Indeed, any film that includes the line "It's gonna blow!" needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. But the second half also involves some great action - notably a car chase that involves the monstrous Batmobile driving across rooftops - and striking images - such as Batman perceived as a demonic figure with glowing red eyes by those who've succumbed to the aforementioned drug.\u000a																\u000a																Here Batman is a figure of horror, designed to strike fear. One perennially interesting strain of the Batman mythology is the tension between Bruce Wayne and the dark Batman. Effectively, the real Bruce Wayne is the one who is subsumed into the "monster" he creates, while the playboy the public sees is a ruse, a feint. \u000a																\u000a																At the core of Batman is a moral dilemma, and questions about the distinctions between justice and revenge. Wayne is motivated entirely by anger, but his thirst for vengeance is expressed by a desire to uphold the law, despite him bending it with his nocturnal activities. Here, Alfred is explicitly Wayne's moral compass, who keeps Bale's character a step away from being another American Psycho. Our hero also stays on the ethically straight-and-narrow through his association with the benign Fox, and both Rachel and Gordon, figures within the legal structure who remain uncorrupted. The fact that this interesting characterisation is framed within a suitably broody, handsome and dynamic film makes it all the better.\u000a

Where Reservoir Dogs was, for all its energy and action, an oddly theatrical thriller, Pulp Fiction is a resolutely cinematic work, awash, like its predecessor, with homages to Jean-Luc Godard and film noir, boasting a knockout, highly quotable screenplay and a cool, eclectic soundtrack. \u000a																\u000a																In this genuinely original piece of cinema, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are hopeless romantics and hopeless villains holding up a diner.

He doesn't know if the man sitting next to him is his best friend or sworn enemy. He can't even remember if the bottle of Scotch he's clutching is to get him pissed or to bash over the head of his assailant. What assailant? Exactly. His confusion intensifies when he gets caught up with drug dealers who readily abuse his condition. He's developed a system of cataloguing events and characters from his investigations with Polaroids, charts and tattoos (allowing for repeated exposure of the Pearce torso) but these are just as susceptible to manipulation, and finding the real killer becomes increasingly tricky.

VWinner of five Oscars, three BAFTAs and three Golden Globes The Apartment is a true classic. It's about advancement, ambition, corruption and adultery, and it operates as both a satire and a sorrowful romance. Director Wilder and co-writer Diamond reunited with star Jack Lemmon after the three of them had worked on 1959's Some Like It Hot, setting sights set on something more intense. The Apartment is defined by its scabrousness, sleaze and the sadness arising from one central character, Lemmon's put-upon CC Baxter, who spends most of the film looking on while his boss beds the woman he loves. That woman, Shirley MacLaine's Fran Kubelik, is herself the victim of exploitation by that boss, Fred MacMurray's amiably obnoxious Mr Sheldrake, a heartless patriarch if ever there was one. Without getting into the nitty gritty of how much both Baxter and Fran suffer, and the odiousness of their male colleagues, the bottom line with The Apartment is that no one (bar maybe Clifford Odets with Sweet Smell Of Success) wrote dialogue as smart, incisive and witty as Wilder and Diamond, and The Apartment is the prime period of their collaboration. As well as providing a lot of smart laughs and a touching romance, they don't pull any punches in their portrait of married corporate men, merrily conforming to the odious stereotypes in their infidelity and abuse of underlings.How about Sheldrake trying to defend his philandering? "Ya know, you see a girl a couple of times a week, just for laughs, and right away they think you're gonna divorce your wife. Now I ask you, is that fair?" to which Baxter replies, "No, sir, it's very unfair. Especially to your wife." Of course, it's not just about the writing itself, it's that alchemical process where the right actors are handling it, and Lemmon is particularly adept at bringing it to life. MacLaine and MacMurray are no slouches either.\u000aThe Apartment is a film laden with bittersweet desperation, as the nice but pathetic Baxter longs for Fran but can't quite stand up to his bosses. There would be no moral in the story if "Buddy" Baxter didn't come good in the end. However, the happy ending is a long time coming, as Wilder and Diamond wring out every last drop of humanity from Sheldrake and his grotesque comrades presenting their case about their horrendous ethics.

V\u000aThe story and the soundtrack you know about. The hype and controversy too. Trainspotting, with its exhilarating approach to desperation, addiction and death, was one of the most vital British movies of the 1990s.  Unlike previous films dealing with heroin culture - Christiane F, The Basketball Diaries - Danny Boyle's film has a comic strain so potent it deserves a health warning all its own. The plot itself is profoundly bleak but with kinetic style and relentless energy Boyle finds sympathy for Irvine Welsh's hopeless, drug-hungry scamsters.\u000aInitial reaction, it's worth remembering, wasn't favourable and the film was criticised for glamorising smack. It doesn't. Ewan McGregor's Renton, amiable but morally ambivalent, succeeds - sort of - on the back of his sorry, selfish charm. His mates fare far, far worse.\u000aThere's the corruption of Tommy (Kevin McKidd), the death of Allison's (Susan Vidler) baby and Renton's grim response. ("I'm cooking up.") Robert Carlyle visibly vibrates as the violent Begbie and Johnny Lee Miller's Sean Connery-obsessed Sick Boy introduces a degree of knowing comedy. Boyle's slightly longer cut of the film on the 'Definitive Edition' DVD also provides a chance to follow the fate of Mother Superior/Swanney (Peter Mullan), whose intravenous habit costs him significantly more than in the original theatrical release. No one gets off lightly, and though early scenes celebrate the uneasy camaraderie of outlaw drug buddies, by the end everything and everyone is screwed.\u000aPivotal to Trainspotting's success is its use of music to echo and emphasise these characters' trajectories. Iggy Pop and Lou Reed knew all about the cyclical monotony of a life reduced to crave, hit and crave. At the film's heart however is the synthetic pulse of Underworld's 'Born Slippy' and the final scene blends image and tune to devastating effect.\u000aTrainspotting set the style for an era, and seemed to herald a new age of British cinema. It's interesting now to compare Trainspotting's energy, style and structure with Boyle's Oscar-nabbing Slumdog Millionaire - there are distinct similarities.\u000aAll involved here give class-A performances, Boyle's direction is brilliantly ingenious and whole stretches of the script remain burned upon the brain. Trainspotting provides ample evidence that even the grimmest subject matter can make a great film. It's just a question of how you harness that raw power.\u000a

VIdentity. Supremacy. Ultimatum. The titles of the Bourne films reflect their terse, taciturn character Jason Bourne. He's the ex-CIA assassin who was plucked from the Mediterranean as an amnesiac in The Bourne Identity and saw his fugitive hopes of domesticity destroyed in The Bourne Supremacy.\u000a																\u000a																The who-am-I? impetus propelled those first two instalments and it's no surprise that it crops up again here in what various sources have claimed is the final entry in the Bourne saga. But although Jason Bourne discovers his real name and retraces his first steps into the CIA's shady Treadstone programme, it's fair to say he's still a mystery by the time the credits roll. And that's what gives this classy thriller its smarts.\u000a																\u000a																In 2007's summer of jaded Hollywood sequels, remakes and multi-million dollar adverts for toys The Bourne Ultimatum is something special: a blockbuster with brains as well as brawn. Sticking close to the original movies (though deviating wildly from Robert Ludlum's novels), it's a threequel that manages to retain its freshness by dint of its craftsmanship, not gimmicks. Using his over-the-shoulder shaky-cams, British director Paul Greengrass stages the action with balls, employing real locations and a small crew to deliver the kind of verite he put to different use in Bloody Sunday and United 93.\u000a																An early nerve-fraying sequence in London's Waterloo Station sets the taut, credible tone as Bourne (Matt Damon) meets whistle-blowing reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) from the 'Guardian', who's running a story on the CIA's Treadstone programme.\u000a																\u000a																The ensuing game of cat and mouse plays out with nerve-fraying tension as Bourne dodges covert operatives on the station concourse, while CIA/NSA suits led by agency mandarin Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) run the show in real-time from behind banks of monitors halfway around the world. It's like a steroid-abusing version of '24' and begs the question: how much did the original films inspire the clock-ticking TV drama?\u000a																\u000a																The series has always had a keen sense of the division of labour in the spy industry, as senior suits wash their hands of the dirty business that happens on the ground. The screenplay plays that expediency to the hilt and adds a muted political dimension to Jason Bourne and his reasons for joining the CIA.\u000a																\u000a																The revelation and flashbacks that show his initiation make him a morally ambivalent figure whose hero status seems to be eroding with each new instalment. There's a subversive undercurrent at work here and the film's understated take on the limits of patriotism is surprisingly daring - although so underplayed that many may overlook it.\u000a																Greengrass keeps such concerns simmering under the surface but doesn't forget he's supposed to deliver an action blockbuster. The results are exhilarating: the Waterloo opening gives way to a motorbike/foot chase through a Tangier market; a Manhattan car chase with Damon behind the wheel of a NYPD cruiser. The shooting style is immersive. You flinch, tense and dodge as Damon unleashes Bourne's inimitable Krav Maga moves, the bone-crunching sound effects expressing every snapped wrist, every choke hold.\u000a																\u000a																Matt Damon's intimated that this may well be his last outing in the role. With three films already under his belt that may be the smartest move to make, especially since it's debatable how much more plot and CIA double-crosses the franchise can credibly sustain.\u000a																\u000a																If it ends here, it'll end on a high note. True, there'll still be more questions than answers - but the mystery of Bourne was always part of his dangerous, disorienting allure.

V\u000a\u000a\u000aMarvel\u2019s latest gamble shows the studio is riding a wave of self-confidence across mountains of cash in the wake of successfully defying Hollywood common sense by hiring directors like cult favourite Shane Black (Iron Man 3) and a couple of guys best known for TV\u2019s Arrested Development and Community (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) to look after some of their most lucrative properties. They\u2019ve upped the stakes here by pairing James Gunn, director of Slither and Super \u2013 neither of which troubled box office bean counters \u2013 with some of Marvel\u2019s craziest characters in the form of Guardians of the Galaxy, and the result is an exciting thrill-ride that strikes a brilliant balance between jaw-dropping space scenes, anarchic wit and bountiful belly laughs.\u000aComing across as perhaps the least shackled by the requirements of a typical origin story of any Marvel film to date, Guardians of the Galaxy quickly dispenses with its dramatic back story right up front, before picking up years later with Peter Quill (the wisecracking Chris Pratt) embarking on a futuristic Indiana Jones-like heist prologue that sets the visually spectacular, quip-heavy tone.\u000aFrom here, Gunn\u2019s universe-building proves assured, quickly rolling out all manner of crazy-coloured, CGI and prosthetic-wearing aliens free of any need to keep things grounded for simple Earthlings. By the time a raccoon and a walking tree turn up and talk to each other it\u2019s just the latest oddity to behold, and the pair become crucial elements of the film\u2019s quintet of heroes (alongside Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista), all of whom boast scene-stealing moments and the charisma to balance Pratt\u2019s star turn.\u000aWhile it may lack a great villain, there\u2019s so much awesomeness going on with Guardians that there\u2019s almost no room for one.

Then in a breathtaking cut we move from a lit match to the sun burning over the film's real star, the Arabian desert. Lean and cinematographer Young clearly fell for the desert as much as Lawrence himself, and they ensure that the audience shares their love. The film strips down the story to its basics, following the struggle of the unhinged anti-hero to help establish a united Arab nation. O'Toole is wonderfully intense in the lead, but his characterization of a man of unfathomable motivations gets lost in the grandeur of his surroundings - the vast, exquisitely composed desertscapes and breathtaking battle scenes.

Frequently, adults are left out of the equation. And, sometimes the action is so frenetic, that only anklebiters get anything out of it. Such is the case with \u201cPenguins of Madagascar.\u201d\u000aYes, penguins are cute. But, the ones coming out of Dreamworks are also obnoxious and headache-producing. The mad pacing in \u201cPenguins of Madagascar\u201d exposes a lack of wit and substance. It is to be endured, not enjoyed. Unless, of course, you are very young. Toddlers to ten.\u000aThese are the penguins from the \u201cMadagascar\u201d franchise, of course. Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights), the rookie. After an opening sequence set in Antarctica, the birds break into Fort Knox to find a vending machine with a discontinued hard-to-find snack. Never mind the gold reserves. Penguins move on their stomachs.\u000aAfter consuming their fill of the cheesy snacks, the quartet is kidnapped by a talking squid known as Dave. Dave despises penguins. They constantly steal the show away from his inkness, getting him kicked out of zoos all over the world. It seems Dave used to be the favorite. I don\u2019t know how that happened since penguins have always been around. What zoo was Dave at, where he was the main attraction?\u000aDave plots to kidnap all zoo penguins and turn them into mutants as revenge for his falling into disfavor. That\u2019s all you need to know, since the story goes at such a furibund pace, there\u2019s little time to absorb plot points. Forget about the story. Just let the kids look at the pretty pictures.\u000aWhat would I have done to make \u201cPenguins of Madagascar\u201d more palatable? Easy. Slow things down and concentrate on the jokes. Use the Marx Brothers as a pattern with Skipper as Groucho, Kowalski as Chico, Rico as Harpo and Private as Zeppo (who knows?) Maybe write Private out of the story. Instead of the usual mad scientist (Dave) routine, find something original and funny to write about. Use some wit and fancy, and stop worrying about ADHD. Today\u2019s children will get it.

V\u000a"I reject nature!" declares young penguin Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath) in the Antarctic. Not one to leave any penguin behind, he, Kowalski (Chris Miller) and Rico (Conrad Vernon) stray from the colony to rescue an imperilled egg, and end up zoo exhibits, escape artists and elite agents. Yet if the third film in the Madagascar series took place in a circus, the surreal-jiving penguins have always played sideshow freaks to the lion, giraffe, hippo and zebra who are the franchise's main attractions. Now, after a dry run in several dedicated cartoon shows for television, these strange birds get their first solo flight of fancy in Penguins Of Madagascar, hoping to be recognised in their own right - much as their buddy Private (Christopher Knights) longs to be regarded as a valued member of the team rather than merely as a cute 'sidekick/mascot' to the other penguins.\u000aThe plot, involving a vengeful octopus (voiced by John Malkovich!) with a mutant-monster-making ray gun, is an entirely disposable Bond parody (including the most insane Venice canal chase you will ever see) - and not so very different from the story in Despicable Me 2, whose cute chorus of Minions is soon also to get its own feature. Better to watch Penguins Of Madagascar for its breakneck banter, manic mayhem, postmodern pastiche and terrible puns - all of which is no less disposable, but infectiously hilarious. With their irrepressible can-do spirit and eschewal of gravity's laws, these fast-talking waddlers deviate from the flock, and from the image of penguins-vs-cruel-nature seen in innumerable documentaries (lampooned at the beginning, with a cameo from none other than the real Werner Herzog). When Skipper rejects nature, he embraces fantasy, allowing this 3D animated absurdity, in all its patchiness, to take wing.\u000a

VIngmar Bergman is famed for his pessimism and a wryly ironic attitude, which frequently dissolves into anguish and despair. Bergman films are hardly universal fare and they're ludicrously at odds with multiplex values. It's doubly ironic, then, that Wild Strawberries, if it were to suffer the indignities of a remake, could easily be turned into superior Hollywood feelgood material. Woody Allen paid extensive homage to it in Deconstructing Harry, another story of a world weary highbrow returning to his alma mater.  Wild Strawberries is the story of an ageing doctor, Professor Isak Borg (a wonderful performance from Victor Sjöström), who describes himself, frankly, as an old pedant with no need or time for other people. Off the cuff, he decides to drive nine hours to a ceremony where he will be honoured for his lifelong devotion to medicine. He's accompanied on the journey by his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Thulin), who makes no secret of her dislike for the icy, empty and self-satisfied Isak.\u000aThe story, always laden with symbolism, flashes back from Isak's  troubled present to his youth, and shifts between dreams and reality. At  Marianne's prompting, and with the help of a trio of young people he  picks up en route, Isak considers his life choices, revisiting the early  disappointments and betrayals that conspired to make him who he is.  Delightfully, Isak acts on this new self-knowledge, opening himself up  to the world after so many years of icy disengagement. This is hardly  the stock Bergman unhappy ending, although it's worth remembering he was  adept at comedy, as shown in Smiles Of A Summer Night, among  others. But the warm-heartedness of the story makes it tremendously  accessible, and the story never spills over into sentimentality.\u000a \u000aRead reviews of other Ingmar Bergman films screening on Film4 from 4th to 17th July 2011\u000aGo to TV listings

VNo stylistic trick or visual flourish is left unused in Martin Scorsese's stab at the world of gothic noir, a world he less stabs at than leaps on top of, blade in hand, and proceeds to perforate to death.\u000a																\u000a																As Leonardo DiCaprio's policeman investigates the disappearance of an inmate from an isolated island-bound 1950s asylum, we're subjected to lurid dream sequences, clanging sound effects, lashing rain, messed up inmates with soulful eyes, more rain, a creepy senior psychiatrist, some possible Nazi war criminals, an escaped murderer, diabolical medical experiments, and even more rain, until you're not quite sure whether it's you or the filmmakers who have lost it.  Is DiCaprio aboard a movie or a fairground ghost train? He's not sure, we're not sure, but Scorsese, a gleeful conductor, is too busy readying the next trapdoor surprise - viewer, behold, a plague of rats! - to let us in on what he thinks he's up to.\u000a																\u000a																It's easy to mock, but I'm undecided on whether Shutter Island's ludicrousness is wholly a bad thing. The film clearly takes itself far too seriously given all the rat plagues and dream sequences and what have you, but it's rarely less than watchable, in the same way that a ghost train is fun for the duration and may have moments where its cheap tricks are more effective than you would afterwards like to admit. It's undeniably visually arresting, with a dark palette scattershot with queasy reds and greens, and some claustrophobic camerawork evoking the trapped sensations of the island-bound policeman.\u000a																\u000a																If Shutter Island were a website it would  be a Geocities fanpage dedicated to the possibility that JFK is alive and well and living in a secret government lab made of bricks fashioned from a new strain of super strong LSD by The Man, and it would be festooned with flashing icons, excitable punctuation, plenty of all-caps typing and hysterical auto-play music with no switch-off option.\u000a																\u000a																While some might argue that suddenly dipping into gothic noir is a strange leftfield choice for a director at Scorsese's time of life, it's much more interesting than continuing to retread old  themes and genres that he has already mastered. That he hasn't got it quite right is hardly the point - I'd rather have seen this flawed but fascinating attempt to journey out of his comfort zone than yet another piece about male rivals getting scrappy with one another.

VWyler's classic emotional rollercoaster focuses on three Second World War vets who return home from the conflict to find things irrevocably changed. Not only are they physically disabled as a result of the War, but the families they left behind have also been marked and altered by events. By concentrating on the trio's inner conflict rather than their combat glories, Wyler paints a deeply moving picture of ordinary people struggling to repair their lives. Through these individual experiences he shows us, movingly and poignantly, the after-effects of war on humanity. March and Andrews are both superb, but the real acting honours here go to real life amputee Russell, who gives a quite remarkable performance as Homer, the remaining member of the trio, who is struggling to cope with the loss of his hands.

VCowboys & Aliens, directed by Iron Man's Jon Favreau, opens with that old Western staple, the Man Of Few Words, alone in the wilderness. This particular Man Of Few Words is called Jake Lonergan, is played by Daniel Craig, and has no idea how he got way out there in the back of beyond, still less what this weird bracelet thing on his arm is all about. He's obviously one of the titular cowboys, and seems to be the subject of a bout of probably alien-related amnesia. So all we have to do now is wait for the aliens to show up and bring the fight, right? Sadly, most of the films best moments occur before that happens.Lest you're imagining Indiana Jones with tentacles instead of a whip, or Han Solo bursting out of somebody's chest with a ready quip, we should say from the get go that no aliens are played by the other lead-billed star, Harrison Ford. Ford plays Woodrow Dolarhyde, another Man Of Few Words, who quickly enacts another tradition of the old West, a fearsome grump-off, against Daniel Craig's character. The two attempt to out-grump each other from the moment they meet. Who will be crowned the surliest? Who's the biggest crosspatch? Who needs to sit on the naughty step until he can play nicely? We never really find out, because those darned aliens ruin what for a moment there threatened to be an entertaining Western throwback.These aliens, which resemble the 'prawn' creatures of District 9, never really convince. Their motives are less alien, more piratical (there's gold in them thar hills, apparently). They ought to be tough, yet one sniff of the local Native Americans' bows 'n' arrows routine and they're less unidentified flying object, more dropping like flies. And, crucially, we should believe our heroes are credibly in danger, something that is absolutely never the case - you feel that one glower from Butch Crankyface and the Cantankerous Kid and the space invaders would flutter whatever passes for eyelids in their species and be on their merry way, pardner.

VAnother masterful piece of family entertainment from Pixar.
p238
sg4
V\u000aPixar continue the trend of producing American cinema's finest family entertainment with Finding Nemo, which consists of two stories in parallel: one a quest, the other an escape story (which has passing similarities with Chicken Run). Both begin at home on the reef, where Marlin (voiced by Brooks) obsesses over his Nemo (Gould), his only remaining family as a result of a predator snaffling his wife and all but one of their "over 400 eggs". Sick of his father's over-protectiveness ("I promise I will never let anything happen to you," Marlin declared to his last egg), Nemo ventures beyond the reef's "drop-off" into open water. Bad timing - he's taken by divers and finds himself in a tank in a dentist's surgery in Sydney. There, he's befriended by the other residents, including starfish Peach (Janney) and Moorish Idol fish Gill (Dafoe), the leader of the tank community who's constantly planning escape attempts (mainly fixated with the toilet - "All drains lead to the ocean!"). They're a good bunch, but Nemo is depressed. Worst still, he's due to become a pet to the dentist's sadistic "fish-killer" niece. So the escape plans become more desperate. Marlin, though he doesn't know it, has a race against time.\u000aAs his quest starts, Marlin meets Dory (DeGeneres), a thoroughly forgetful blue tang fish. "Is this some kind of practical joke?" Marlin asks of her supposed idiocy. "I suffer from short-term memory. It runs in my family. At least I think it does," she replies. Finding a mask dropped by one of the divers who took Nemo, the pair head for an address in Sydney.\u000aA plot based on travelling the ocean allows Pixar to indulge in a wonderful array of scenarios and characterisation. So, the pair meet three Aussie sharks (Humphries, Bana, Spence), who have a self-help collective where they get together to renew their vows - as Humphries' Great White Bruce puts it: "I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. Fish are friends not food." Then they encounter a shoal that does impressions by forming the shapes of things - including poor, miserable Marlin himself - becoming an arrow to point them to the East Australian Current. A more dangerous situation arises when the pair find themselves in the thick of a mass of jellyfish. Relief is then provided by a group of turtles riding the current, like surfers. Indeed, Crush the turtle is voiced by writer-director Andrew Stanton in true surfer-stoner style ("Taking on the jellies - you've got serious thrill issues, dude. Awesome."). There's also a pelican, Nigel, voiced by Rush, who helps out Marlin and Dory because he's enjoying their saga and wants to spite the greedy seagulls.\u000aIt's great stuff - vivid, imaginative, wonderfully voiced by all involved and, this being Pixar, it's also cheeky. There's a sly dig at the habit in Disney films for characters to burst into song: when Dory tries to comfort Marlin with a tune, he says "Dory - no singing!" There are few fart and wee gags ("Don't you people realise we are swimming in our own sh..." says one of the tank fish during an escape plan that involves breaking the filter. "Shhhhh, here we go!"). There's even a very gentle knocking of the US ("Humans, they think they own everything." "Probably American."). The biggest laugh comes with Dory speaking whale language (several dialects of it, in fact). Exasperated by her awful noises, Marlin says: "Dory - this is not 'whale'. You're speaking like an upset stomach." The filmmakers - headed up by Stanton, who also co-wrote and co-directed 1998's A Bug's Life - even manage to squeeze in some neat film references: among them The Shining (Bruce bursting through a door in a sub wreck - "Heeeeere's Brucie!"), The Birds (a high angle view of gulls crowding), and The Perfect Storm (a fishing boat during the denouement).\u000a

VSince 'misery memoirs' are now as grimly familiar as the daytime TV shows that have popularized them in recent years, it's little wonder the phrase has become banal almost to the point of meaninglessness. Featuring some of the most relentlessly grim production design in recent British cinema and a protagonist who suffers cruel violence from most people he encounters in the film, Nic Moran's adaptation of Kevin Lewis' best-selling autobiographical novels is a stark reminder of its true sense. From the moment we meet Kevin, dumped on a roadside following a savage beating, he's bruised and battered, and - whether through extended flashbacks to his brutally abusive childhood, or in his adult life as a bare-knuckle boxer forced to inhabit London's criminal underworld - rarely a scene goes by where he's not used as a punchbag. \u000a																\u000a																The effect of portraying such extreme, sustained violence inevitably verges - at best - on the numbing, but here it's the air of parody that's most problematic. If you sat down to watch The Kid, blissfully unaware it was modeled on fact rather than fiction, the queasily familiar story arc (mistreated, deprived but bright boy finds love and comes good), characters (inspiring young English teacher makes Shakespeare cool) and motifs (Kevin's only solace is classical music, listened to on Walkman given to him by inspiring young English teacher) would probably make you scoff. Nor does it help that the abominably miscast Natascha McElhone, as Kevin's unhinged mother and chief abuser - fully 'uglied' up, in false teeth, NHS glasses, housecoat, with fag drooping from perma-snarl and a bawling baby surgically attached to her person - is played as a one-dimensional pantomime villain with shades of Janet Street Porter. \u000a																\u000aRupert Friend's own performance as the fey, softly spoken Kevin is also slightly baffling. Though final reel footage, of a TV piece featuring Lewis on the sofa with - you've guessed it - Fern Britton, reveals his impersonation to be spot-on. Still, as with his mother's characterization, though we're supposedly being told Kevin's story through his own eyes, we're in fact only ever shown it - and very opaquely at that. His motivations and the source of the evidently remarkable inner strength required for him to transcend his tragic upbringing, even after spending nearly two hours in his company, remain a mystery.\u000a

VThe first of four collaborations between Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick, the legendary producer of Gone With The Wind, was the setting for a clash of two titanic egos. They slugged it out for overall creative control of the film, each complaining of interference from the other and both men stated that they had misgivings about the final results. They were just about the only doubters, however, as the film proved to be a box office smash as well as garnering no fewer than 11 Oscar nominations (winning two). If anything, it's even more appealing today, with the beautifully photographed cars, clothing and scenery providing a handsome evocation of a lost era, in addition to the timeless quality of the excellent storytelling.\u000a																\u000a																Unusually for a Hitchcock film, the screenplay sticks closely to the source novel. This is no bad thing as the story is so good and already provides Hitch plenty of opportunity for his particular brand of dark psychological exploration and steadily cranked tension. The young wife (Fontaine) of Maxim De Winter (Olivier), the handsome, rich and temperamental owner of the huge stately home Manderley, is struggling to come to terms with her new life. She's haunted by the legacy of Maxim's deceased first wife Rebecca and overawed by her housekeeper, the icy and terrifying Mrs Danvers (Anderson). She's totally unaware of Rebecca's true nature, however, and that Maxim is concealing a secret that has the potential to destroy him.\u000a																\u000a																For once Laurence Olivier doesn't ham it up, delivering a clipped, splendidly moody and even subtle performance. What's more, and equally rare for the great thesp, he imbues his character with great natural warmth, ensuring our sympathy stays with him, no matter how great his crimes seem to be. Olivier's chemistry with Joan Fontaine sets the screen alight - an impressive achievement if credence is given to the stories that he barely had the time of day for the actress, furious that Vivien Leigh (his first choice for the role and girlfriend at the time) didn't get the part.Naturally, Hitchcock is said to have used this situation to his advantage, teasing the young ingénue Fontaine (she was just 21) mercilessly, while encouraging the rest of the cast to treat her coldly. The tactic led to a performance that strikes just the right tone of diffidence, nerviness and downright terror and goes a long way to proving that the young star was far more than just a pretty face. The biggest acting credit has to go to Judith Anderson, however, whose steel-faced spectral Mrs Danvers casts a dark shadow in every scene she appears in and has quite rightly become a cinema icon.\u000a																\u000a																Everything else works too. There's crisp black-and-white cinematography, a script loaded with morbid humour and sharp dialogue as well and a terrific score used with Hitchcock's usual precision to create a delicious sense of suspense and unease. It all combines to create an atmospheric gem, that's as enjoyable as it is impressive.\u000a

VRent this film now on Film4oD\u000a \u000aJust when the ultra-ironic, ultra-violent thriller seemed to have been done to death by Tarantino and his acolytes, along came the Coen brothers to breathe fresh life into the genre. David Mamet-favourite Macy is wonderfully weak and wicked as Jerry Lundegaard the Swedish-American car-salesman whose attempts to mastermind the perfect crime - the kidnapping of his wife - go horribly, violently and hilariously wrong. For a start he has hired two trigger-happy crooks, the verbose Carl (Buscemi) and the taciturn Gaear (Stormare) to carry out the kidnapping. Pretty soon people are starting to get shot and this attracts the attention of the smart, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand, who deservedly won an Academy Award for her tough, funny, touching performance). With its central plot strand of the well-planned crime spiralling wildly out of control, the film investigates similar territory to the Coen brothers' brilliant debut Blood Simple, but Fargo is a more assured work, lighter and more layered. The cast, boasting at least three scene-stealing performances (Macy, McDormand and Buscemi), are on top form. The film manages the neat trick of trumping Tarantino by not merely being filled with laughs and slickly handled, literally visceral action sequences, but also presenting rounded, recognizably human characters.

V\u000aIt's difficult to say anything about The Godfather that hasn't been said already, but know this: it is a geniune cinematic masterpiece, and rightly deserves its revered status.\u000aReleased in 1972 in what's considered to be a golden era for film, The Godfather had somewhat humble beginnings. Based on the Mario Puzo novel, the film was initially rejected by a number of directors before being handed to Francis Ford Coppola when he was still a 31-year-old Hollywood up-and-comer. It's to Coppola's credit that, despite fights with Paramount and the constant threat of being fired, he managed to craft a critically and commercially lauded film that set a new benchmark for Hollywood epics.\u000aAs with any film of its stature, The Godfather has embedded itself so deeply into popular culture that you can feel you've viewed the film several times without ever having watched a single frame. The horse's head in the bed; Marlon Brando's distinctive mumbling; the evocative theme music; classic quotes such as "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" - it's all here. The Godfather is much more than fodder for bad parodies, though. It is testament to this engaging and intricate film's quality that the three hour running time is a blessing rather than a curse.\u000aThe detailed plot revolves around the Corleone family, Italian immigrants that have been guided to Mafia supremacy through the questionable "business" dealings of family head Don Vito Corleone (Brando in an Oscar winning role). A fresh-faced Al Pacino undertakes his first big starring role as Michael Corleone, son of Vito and recent returnee from the battlefields of WWII. What distances Michael from his family, however, is a desire to go legit - a wish supported by the Don who has dreams of Michael becoming a Senator.\u000aAs is the case when your lifestyle mainly revolves around blackmail, robbery and murder, things soon go awry: Vito's reign is challenged by other Mafia families intent on getting a slice of the ever-growing drug trade. Don Vito's refusal to deal in narcotics leads to a lengthy feud that has irreversible repercussions for the entire Corleone clan - particularly the increasingly ruthless Michael.\u000aFeaturing note-perfect performances from everyone involved, a brilliantly written Oscar-winning script from Coppola and Puzo and deft direction, The Godfather satisfies film lovers on any number of levels and will have them salivating in anticipation of the equally brilliant (and, for many, superior) Part II of the trilogy.\u000aIn a nutshell: A multi-generational epic that never leaves the audience less than enthralled, this is the godfather of all gangster films\u000a\u000a

V\u000aMia Wasikowska is the new girl in Hollywood in \u201cMaps to the Stars.\u201d\u000a\u201cMaps to the Stars\u201d is more about obsessed celebrities than celebrity obsession, so perhaps the title isn\u2019t appropriate. Hollywood breathes a special kind of oxygen, and director David Cronenberg attempts to satirize the goings-on. But, his efforts to mock show business are just so much vinegar and vulgarity. Nothing funny or enlightening in this portrayal of the entertainment industry.\u000aBig problem: The film lacks a protagonist. You could argue that limousine driver Jerome Fontana (Robert Pattinson) fits the bill. But, very little of the story bounces off his character. The other roles, Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore), Agatha Weiss (Mia Wasikowska), Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack), Cristina Weiss (Olivia Williams) and Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird) are living too hard in their freaky worlds for anyone to climb into their skins.\u000a\u201cMaps to the Stars\u201d is absurdist cinema. Havana is a washed-up actress hoping to get back into the game by starring in a remake of the film that made her late mother famous. She frequently hallucinates a younger version of her mother. Agatha (Wasikowska) becomes Havana\u2019s personal assistant shortly after arriving in L.A.  Agatha knows Carrie Fisher (cameo appearance) through Twitter, and Fisher recommends her to Havana.\u000aDr. Weiss is a celebrity psychologist who gives personal life lessons and training to Havana. Cristina, Stafford\u2019s wife, obsesses over the acting career of her son, Benjie. The teen sensation (Bird) is a horse\u2019s ass in real life. After a stint in rehab, he\u2019s now ready to resume his superstar life in a franchise film series called \u201cBad Babysitter.\u201d Everyone behaves badly. Everyone seems to be in an incestuous relationship, some are quite literally.\u000aDespite some fine performances, \u201cMaps to the Stars\u201d fails to entertain or even make sense, at times. It\u2019s more odd than comical. It\u2019s peculiar without being droll. The film needed a satisfactory POV. Instead, there\u2019s only a disconnect with the characters.

VThe crew are at the receiving end of a seemingly obscure command structure, and orders often make less and less sense as they are filtered down to the front line. Experiencing the war first-hand, the tired and edgy crew have little chance to relax, as the enemy could be lurking anywhere beyond the steel hull of the creaking submarine. Director Petersen exploits his claustrophobic setting to maximum effect, paradoxically using a steady-cam which rushes through the cramped interior only adding to the sense of isolation. While the anti-war message isn't much to write home about, Das Boot (The Boat) still makes compulsive viewing. But the truth is simple: what makes it (and the TV series) float are the soap opera mechanics.

Hoffman was perfectly cast (legend has it that Robert Redford was originally offered the role) as the jaw-droppingly naive Benjamin. Katherine Ross is demure as Elaine, while Bancroft - who is only six years older than Hoffman in real life - got the part of a lifetime, and knew exactly what to do with it (and has not been bettered by the actresses who have attempted the role in the theatre version). \u000a																\u000a																Throw in Simon and Garfunkel's fitting soundtrack and a host of skilled supporting actors - including William Daniels, Walter Brooke (who mutters the immortal advice, "Plastics!") and Murray Hamilton - then sit back and enjoy one of the classic films of the 1960s.

Hugely expensive for its time, it has every dollar evident on screen, and it is easy to be seduced by its sumptuous visuals, to feel the heat of Atlanta burning. But this is Hollywood style over substance writ large, almost casually sexist and racist, using the Civil War as a convenient backdrop without ever addressing its social or historical significance.  Dissecting it further, the plot is pure soap opera and the acting, particularly from Gable, is often wooden.

V"I'm really thirsty. When I was a kid I used to dehydrate, and my piss came out like snot. I mean, it was all thick and gross." Just a throwaway piece of dialogue from Christopher McQuarrie's otherwise quotable Oscar-winning screenplay for The Usual Suspects. Watch Bryan Singer's awesome neo-noir a second time and you might find that this seemingly extraneous information gives a big clue to the real identity of arch criminal Keyser Soze.\u000a																\u000a																It's now often the case with cult films that their popularity stems from the need to subject them to the sort of examination usually reserved for the Patterson Bigfoot film. But while many films might claim that only repeat viewers will understand the storyline, The Usual Suspects really does reward those prepared to put it under the microscope a second, third or fourth time. And we're not talking about some phoney mystery here - of the sort at the heart of The Big Sleep, a story so dense not even its author Raymond Chandler could understand it. The Usual Suspects presents all the clues. It just happens to also provide more than one solution.\u000a																\u000a																"Five criminals. One line-up. No coincidence." The Usual Suspects' tagline neatly summed up what seemed to be a pretty simple situation. The suspects in question include Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a copper-turned-con who some believe might hold domain over the criminal underworld, and Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), a meek crippled conman who is one of two men to survive a shoot out in an LA harbour. Brought in for questioning by customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), 'Verbal' explains the events leading up to him, Keaton and the three other cons being in LA that evening. And as he talks, Kujan becomes convinced that Kint can finger Keyser Soze, a bad guy who could even spook James Bond.\u000a																Any crime movie where the cop is played by Chazz Palminteri - one the movie world's favourite Mafiosi - is a pretty interesting proposition. Indeed, with so many of the cast being equally at home playing heroes or villains, the mystery at the heart of The Usual Suspects is treacle thick and twice as sticky. The film that introduced the wider world to Bencio Del Toro, Singer's film features career-best work from Byrne, Kevin Pollack and Steve Baldwin, three actors who might be bigger were they always as good as they are here. The film also throws some interesting curve-balls in the shape of cameos from Suzy Amis as the lawyer for whom Keaton has given up his life of crime, Giancarlo Espositio as a no-nonsense cop and an uncredited Peter Greene as the charismatic fence Redfoot. There's even a brief appearance by the late great actor-director Paul Bartel to muddy the water that little bit further.\u000a																\u000a																Of course, the lion's share of the praise should go to Kevin Spacey who rightly won an Oscar albeit in the wrong category (Verbal is in no sense a supporting role) and McQuarrie who wrote the script in his early twenties while working for a law firm. As for Singer being overlooked for his contribution, it's a crime on the same scale as the one carried out in the final reel. That all three have struggled (or, in the case of McQuarrie, completely failed) to top their work here is as disappointing as it is to be expected. For had it been made 40 years ago by a genre legend like Howard Hawks , we'd be talking about The Usual Suspects as a bona fide movie milestone. That's the scale of the achievement on show here, the cinema equivalent of scaling Everest.

V\u000aChadwick Boseman definitely feels the vibe that was James Brown in \u201cGet On Up.\u201d\u000aHard to imagine anyone else in the role of singer James Brown than actor Chadwick Boseman. He nails it. Bozeman rises above the material in \u201cGet On Up,\u201d now in its home entertainment release. You may not like the way the story is presented, but you can certainly appreciate the talent involved.\u000aThe hardest working man in show business lived a complicated life, but that was no reason to make his story hard to follow. The screenplay bounces like a ping-pong ball from childhood to prison to manhood to early showbiz to late showbiz to Brown\u2019s mental problems. It makes you want to scream out for a more linear approach.\u000aThere\u2019s nothing wrong with flashbacks and flash forwards. Most movies use at least a flashback or two to help tell their stories. But, \u201cGet On Up\u201d turns Brown\u2019s life into popcorn. It\u2019s like catching the kernels as they jump out of the pan. Unless you\u2019re already familiar with the singer\u2019s life, it\u2019s confusing. So many people were a part of this man\u2019s history. It deserved a better telling.\u000aSo, let\u2019s cover the positive. Boseman. The guy has talent, and it\u2019s on display. He captures Brown from start to finish. From his early convictions that he could be something special to the excesses of super-stardom. Bozeman shows us the doubts, the confidence, the flamboyance, the regrets and the talent (including some amazing dance moves) that made Brown a living legend.\u000aThe story doesn\u2019t give us much about Brown\u2019s political activism, although it shows him convincing the mayor of Boston that he should allow Brown\u2019s concert to go ahead shortly after the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s assassination. It also shows that very concert getting out of hand and how Brown brought things back under control.\u000aThe supporting cast in \u201cGet On Up\u201d is excellent, especially a small scene with Brandon Mychal Smith as Little Richard. Now, I\u2019m ready to see Little Richard\u2019s story.

V\u000a\u000a\u000aGet On Up is at once the most unconventional biopic I\u2019ve ever seen, and a shaggy composite of all of them. The only real difference is James Brown \u2013 but what a difference James Brown makes.\u000aChadwick Boseman dazzles as \u201cThe Godfather of Soul\u201d in a performance more Oscar-worthy than Jamie Foxx\u2019s Ray or Will Smith\u2019s Ali. He channels both the great man and the demons that chased Brown straight onto the stage, moving deftly between showman, manipulator and lost soul.\u000aInitially Get On Up threatens to be an extended SNL send-up, with an opening scene depicting a confused latter-era Brown holding a room full of seminar attendees to ransom with a shotgun because one of them used his bathroom (a true story by all accounts). Thankfully that\u2019s followed by a more dynamic portrayal of a conflicted and gifted man, punctuated with musical set pieces that are among the best ever created for the screen.\u000aIt is with the deepest sympathy then that I understand director Tate Taylor\u2019s reluctance to leave anything on the cutting room floor, but at 140 minutes a more judicious edit would have served it well. Stylistically, there are perhaps too many devices \u2013 a broken fourth wall, time-lapse photography, the introduction of chapters with titles, which are presented in a non-linear fashion.\u000aWith so much going on the pacing loses its rhythm (there\u2019s no funk in the edit, ironically). As a result, a lot of what could have been great comedy dialogue falls flaccid, which is a wasted opportunity when you think of how hilarious Brown was as a public figure (see Eddie Murphy\u2019s Delirious for cliff notes).\u000aGreat performances are let down by some untidy production but it\u2019s a thrilling ride nonetheless.\u000a\u2018Get On Up\u2019 movie times\u000a\u000a

VGet On Up comes off like a checklist guide of how not to make a quality biopic.
p277
sg4
V\u000a\u000aConsidering it\u2019s a movie about one of the most iconic, controversial and genius figures of the last century, Get On Up has received curiously little hype. That comes despite the fact that it appears to have all the right ingredients: a director with bona fides in drawing a solid film from society\u2019s racial past (The Help), a lead actor with the chops to handle a major transformation (Chadwick Boseman, who also played baseball\u2019s barrier-breaker Jackie Robinson in the biopic 42), and a producer who was an associate of the figure in question (Mick Jagger).\u000aIt\u2019s too bad, then, that Get On Up comes off like a checklist guide of how not to make a quality biopic. Here are the lessons for future biopic makers.\u000a1. Don\u2019t ignore the coke addiction and domestic abuse!\u000aThe Godfather of Soul is a complicated figure\u2014evinced by his many, many nicknames\u2014and it was always going to be nearly impossible to take a man best known for transcending stages and capture his essence between the four sides of a big screen. He cultivated a huge number of backing musicians who went on to be prominent artists; he was a generous and largely kind-hearted man to his friends, family and children; he was a creative genius with a massive ego that was frankly well-earned, helping to birth rap music with his 1969 Funky Drummer being the most sampled beat in hip-hop; he was a racial conciliator who, in one of Get On Up\u2018s finest scenes, arguably prevented Boston from rioting in the immediate wake of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s death. But he was also a brutal tyrant to his band, who rode on a bus as he took a plane, and he fined them for their mistakes, with his points and hand gestures on stage doubling as notation of band error. He regularly used PCP and cocaine, a hard-drug problem that was only passingly alluded to in the film by a single shot of Brown rolling cocaine into a cigarette after a personal tragedy. His relationship with rap was complicated, but not more so than his positions on race: he revered senator Strom Thurmond\u2014who ran for president as a Dixiecrat, to oppose desegregation\u2013saying that he was \u201clike a grandfather.\u201d In the film, racial differences and inequality are largely reduced to punchlines.\u000aHe was the Hardest Working Man in Show Business. That comes with a price\u2014but so much of the film implies that his life and career was essentially an easy coronation, when the reality was so different. Instead of showing his frustrations with a label who refused to give him any meaningful creative control in the early \u201960s, forcing him into the groundbreaking tactics of starting his own label and distribution firm, Get On Up makes it feel like it was an easy fait accompli that he was able to pull off. He had to push to get heard, push to have his unique sound succeed, and at times push away the people he cared for the most, which can help explain the wild, sad descent of his later years\u2014little of which was represented by the film. And by not doing it, the effect is similar to watching his remarkable performances on YouTube as well as the depressing, rambling, context-free interviews of his later days. Hagiography, for James Brown, actually does the man a disservice.\u000a\u000a2. Just tell the bloody story.\u000aIt\u2019s not nearly as bad as Wired\u2014the gonzo retelling of the life of John Belushi, curiously told through the perspective of Watergate newsman/Belushi biographer Bob Woodward\u2014but Get On Up frames its story by starting with an inexplicable opening scene of him brandishing a shotgun in an office (details largely fictionalized); Boseman\u2019s Brown even breaks the fourth wall at least three times, which is so rarely a good decision. Its back-and-forth travels through all but the last decade of Brown\u2019s life might have worked if it showed something more profound about the machinations of the man. Instead it highlights the movie\u2019s lack of thesis. There is, for instance, a moving scene near the end featuring Brown\u2019s mother, who abandoned him when he was young, but it comes so abruptly that it takes a minute to realize what it is you\u2019re even seeing. And in one of the final scenes, Boseman\u2019s Brown heads for a stage while thinking out loud, \u201cI paid the cost to be the boss,\u201d a classic Brownism. But in the movie, he has paid no cost at all.\u000aThe better approach: Narrow the focus to hone into one aspect, or a few major moments, of the person\u2019s life. Lincoln, for instance, eschews the retelling of the president\u2019s rise, opting instead to reflect his character through the single storyline of the congressional fight to end slavery.\u000a3. Don\u2019t fall in love with your own star.\u000aIt may be the biggest saving grace of Get On Up: the fact that Boseman is a more than capable Brown imitator, embodying his tics, his growl, his bouffant hair, that regal chin, his assuredness in his body\u2019s electric motions, his supreme swagger. Without that\u2014and some excellent performances by Nelsan Ellis and Viola Davis, the film would be nearly joyless. But in a way, that\u2019s also its downfall\u2014the film is so clearly in awe of Boseman\u2019s performance that it relies on them at the expense of everything else.\u000aIt\u2019s an easy mistake to make in a biopic. Consider Jamie Foxx\u2019s role in Ray, Will Smith\u2019s portrayal of Muhammad Ali, or Ben Kingsley\u2019s embodiment of Mahatma Gandhi: modern biopics tend to build out from how well the lead can emulate the title figure, and work from there. It\u2019s usually a good thing (unless they fail: see Colin Farrell in Alexander). But here it just masks the weakness of the underlying film\u2014as Meryl Streep\u2019s Margaret Thatcher did in The Iron Lady.\u000a\u000a4. You can\u2019t be everything to everyone\u000aIf Get On Up was made for people who had a serious grounding in funk music, it would mean something that we were seeing portrayals of Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker, who the film largely depicted as self-centred. And if it was, it might not need this end title card that comes up at the film\u2019s conclusion: \u201cJames Brown was considered one of the most popular artists of all time.\u201d Anyone with zero knowledge of James Brown leaves the film without a meaningful sense of just how hard Brown really worked, just how hard it was for Brown to wrest creative control, just how low things got before his late-life renaissance, and just how deeply Brown\u2019s influence is still felt today on pop culture, in the disco, funk and rap genres he helped birth as well as on modern performers\u2019 stagecraft.\u000a5. Don\u2019t put yourself in it, for god\u2019s sake\u000aIt\u2019s always a good idea to have someone who knows the figure to make sure that the facts are mostly right, and the narrative is true to itself. To Mick Jagger\u2019s credit, this film wouldn\u2019t have happened if it wasn\u2019t for his ability to clear the rights, and his experiences playing with and being inspired by Brown come from some authority. But Jagger wasn\u2019t really all that close with Brown. Take his fondest memory from the last time he saw Brown live, from an interview with the Huffington Post: \u201cI saw him at a show in Cleveland. I can\u2019t remember when, but we were both there together. I went to see his show, and he came to see me. We had a good time.\u201d Moving stuff. Nevertheless, there\u2019s a scene in the already-lengthy Get On Up where an actor playing young Jagger nods knowingly at Brown.\u000a\u201cI want it to be true to him,\u201d Jagger told USA Today about the film. In this, he certainly failed.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse biopicsGet on UpJames Brown \u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000aAdapted by Tina Fey from Rosalind Wiseman's guide to teen living 'Queen Bees And Wannabes', Mean Girls takes a sledgehammer to everything from cliques to status anxiety. Our companion on this journey through the depressing world of the American teen is Cady (Lindsay Lohan), who discovers that her upbringing in the wilds of Africa is far from adequate preparation for surviving the rigours of the urban academic jungle. That said, she doesn't help herself by ditching the mates she makes on the first day to hang out with The Plastics, a clique run by the formidable Regina (Rachel McAdams).\u000aWhat follows is a tale packed with the type of betrayal and double-cross you'd usually only find in the most incident-packed thriller. And since so many of the characters are winningly played, we're obliged to give a damn about the reversals that affect these young souls and their fragile relationships. With Lohan building on her good work in Freaky Friday, McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried make for the best bitch posse from hell since the Heathers. There are also nice supporting turns from Saturday Night Live regulars Fey, Amy Poehler and Tim Meadows.\u000aOf course, since Mean Girls is a Saturday Night Live production, the drama is served up with tons of gags, which are mainly very funny. From tragic shopping addictions to basic teen stupidity, Waters and Fey mine original humour from these and other familiar topics. And while they have plenty of satirical fun, writer and director never let the social comment get in the way of a good knob gag.\u000aFind out where Mean Girls placed in Charlie Lyne's Top 20 Teen Movies\u000a \u000a

With Grown Ups, Adam Sandler offers all the usual ingredients that made him popular, yet its lazy, slapped-together feel is totally devoid of vim and vigour. It's hard to imagine how a comedy could be any worse.\u000a																\u000a																Sandler plays a successful film agent with spoilt kids and Salma Hayek for a wife (where did her career go wrong?). Chris Rock is the brow-beaten house frau and David Spade is the boozy, sleazy bachelor. It's a simple and puerile world. A world in which the funniest emission a person can make is from their bottom and a world where there are only three types of women: wives who stop men having fun and living the lives they want to live, girls in tiny bikinis and ugly women, whose sub-genres include fat, hairy and old.\u000a																\u000a																It's difficult to see who this film is aimed at. It's far too banal, silly and tedious to appeal to an adult audience, and the basic concept of five adults attempting to reconnect after 30 years of sparse contact won't resonate with younger audiences. From the off it plays like a collection of private jokes (and jokes about privates), fart jokes, long scenes involving jokes about hair, ears and weight, and people falling over into an array of things you wouldn't want to fall into. Of course, important lessons are learned along the way and at the end everybody comes out richer for the experience, except the audience, who leave several pounds poorer.\u000a																\u000a																With Sandler's production company, Happy Madison, having grossed over three billion dollars worldwide to date, Grown Ups plays very much like a vanity project where there's nothing at stake, like the gang were all sat around one night and someone said, "hey, this is really funny, we should totally film us just teasing each other and moaning about our wives and stuff. Grab a camera, head to a beach house and just horse around for a few weeks. If anyone goes to watch it, it's a bonus."

VHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall star in the epitome of film noir cool. The Big Sleep has everything - a plot you'd need diagrams, slides and flow charts to understand; a slew of smart one-liners; a dark, sombre atmosphere; an incredible sexually charged atmosphere (check out the scene where Bogart and Bacall discuss horse racing for double meaning); and the expected soupcon of murderers and dastardly henchmen.  Bogart's plays Ramond Chandler's fast-talking gumshoe Phillip Marlowe. Summoned to the luxurious mansion of General Sternwood (Waldron), he is hired to investigate blackmailer Geiger (Von Eltz), a Hollywood smut merchant who has some compromising photos of the general's daughter, Carmen (Vickers). Marlowe follows the trail to Geiger's home where he finds him dead and Carmen drugged. Taking Carmen home he meets her sister, Vivian (Bacall), and begins an affair that's as riddled with intrigue as the story that follows.

V\u000aJennifer Lawrence in 'Winter's Bone'\u000aThis weekend offers a classic choice between blockbuster entertainment and rugged indie drama\u2014between cartoon fantasy and gritty Ozark realism. Movies great and small for wildly different demographics. But Toy Story 3 and Winter\u2019s Bone  are both tales of characters terrified of losing their home.  In Toy Story 3, a band of played-out toys are driven out of the house as \u201ctheir\u201d child heads off to college, and trapped in a daycare gulag. In Winter\u2019s Bone an intrepid teenage girl trying to save the family house from being sold off plunges into an Ozark mountain underworld in search of her bail-jumping dad. Both movies are worth seeing. Toy Story 3 is a solid sequel to a trusty franchise\u2014a 3D  ride to the dark side of toyland, buffered by sentiment. With enough wit to amuse the parents and enough adventure to captivate the kids. It\u2019s had a lot of attention already. So I\u2019m going to reverse the usual protocol and lead with the little movie, Winter\u2019s Bone (which opens in Toronto today, and expands to Vancouver and Montreal next week)  This Sundance award-winner is a superbly acted, beautifully wrought film. Chances are it will be a contender for my Top 10 list by the time winter comes around.\u000aTalk about counter-programming. The farthest thing you could imagine from the bright summer midway of Iron Men and A-Team hijinks and Karate Kids, Winter\u2019s Bone is an austere, harrowing suspense story of a hard-headed girl who ventures into an Ozark heart of darkness, a backwoods hell of crystal meth and family menace and unforgiving cruelty. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a powerful, unwavering performance as 17-year-old Ree Dolly, who is trying to track down her father. He put up their house for a bail bond then vanished without a trace. If she can\u2019t find him, she will be homeless, along with the rest of her family. As she heads into woods to question friends and relatives, she runs up against an outlaw code of silence and risks her life with each step that takes her closer to the truth behind her dad\u2019s disappearance. She confronts her ruthless addict uncle, the incongruously nicknamed Teardrop (John Hawkes), and passes through a declension of ever darkening characters. The movie\u2019s desaturated palette is expertly controlled. This is a gray world and we don\u2019t see a glimmer of sun in the sky, or a smile from our resilient heroine, until close to the end.\u000aBased on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, the film is set and shot in the mountains of southern Missouri, a world that is captured with stunning authenticity. I was reminded of Canadian director Jennifer Baichwal\u2019s fine documentary, The True Meaning of Pictures: Shelby Adams\u2019 Appalachia. This film portrays mountain culture with the same photographic richness,  avoiding the hillbilly stereotypes, while etching Gothic character portraits of scary potency. And the stark dialogue has an archaic, almost biblical cadence. Director and co-writer Debra Granik, who shot the film in real Ozark family homes, worried about playing into the stereotypes. \u201cMoonshine and meth,\u201d she says, \u201care gasoline on the bonfire of cliches depicting mountain culture. Thirty-five years after Deliverance, even a banjo can still be a loaded symbol. But in our trips down to southern Missouri, banjos kept popping up in the most mysterious and alluring ways. Ultimately the banjo found its way into the film, offering notes of hope and perseverance. I came to think of it as a fresh start for that image.\u201d\u000aAs for Toy Story 3, it does not depart from the safe formula of the previous installments. Don\u2019t expect anything as ingenious as Ratatouille or Up. But the formula works. A few brief observations culled from my recent article on sequels and remakes in the magazine:\u000aEach movie in Disney-Pixar\u2019s Toy Story franchise conforms to a strict narrative template: led by Woody (Tom Hanks), the vintage cowboy doll, a clan of animated toys get separated from their beloved master, Andy, and have to fight their way home. In Toy Story 2, the enemy was a venal collector. In Toy Story 3, Andy is off to college and his toys are once again playing dodgeball with oblivion. Will it be the attic? A yard sale? No, they\u2019re donated to a daycare centre\u2014a prison camp ruled with an iron paw by a strawberry-scented stuffed bear.\u000aWhile the franchise\u2019s sentimental mould is inviolable, this sequel has a darker, more satirical edge. Some of the Orwellian daycare toys are quite scary, like the mad-eyed, cymbal-crashing monkey on surveillance duty, or the big, blank-eyed baby doll. And in an apocalyptic set piece, the toys are sent on a harrowing flume ride through trash shredders to landfill hell. I\u2019m not giving anything away by saying that this Toy Story, like the others, ends happily. Some things will never change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse Daniel WoodrellDebra GranikJennifer BaichwalJennifer LawrenceToy Story 3Winter's Bone \u000a\u000a\u000a

VRent Toy Story 3 now from Film4oD\u000a \u000aPixar might have had a bit of a wobble with Cars and Ratatouille, but since then it's been wall-to-wall masterpieces: Wall-E, Up and now Toy Story 3, which sees the welcome return of Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen). The pairing of the amiable cowboy doll and deluded space ranger toy first occurred 15 years before Toy Story 3. Can you believe it? Fifteen years! So it makes sense that in this long-awaited third film in Pixar's hit series time has also passed. Where once Andy was a six-year-old boy, adoringly playing with his favourite toys, now he's a young man, poised to leave for college.\u000aThe main thrust of the story here is the question of how the toys cope when the boy becomes the man, and puts away childish things. Do they get landfilled? Or retired to the attic? Or circulated to a childcare centre? Or passed on to another child? Most of those options are explored in Toy Story 3. Andy decides to take Woody with him to college and store the rest of the crew - Buzz, Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Mr Potato Head (Don Rickles), Mrs Potato Head (Estelle Harris), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and co - in the attic. Unfortunately, he puts them in a bin bag, which Mum takes to be rubbish and leaves out for the binmen. Fortunately, they escape and, believing Andy has rejected them, climb into a box for the daycare centre, and Woody catches up and joins them.When they arrive at "Sunnyside", all seems blissful - they're greeted warmly by the leader of the toys, Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) and there are plenty of kids to play with them. Woody doesn't give up on Andy so easily though, so he escapes, and is picked up by a little girl called Bonnie. The others, meanwhile, discover all is not as it seems at Sunnyside - as new arrivals they're put in the pre-school room, where they're brutally "chewed, kicked, drooled on" by toddlers who haven't reached the stage of imaginative play yet. Sunnyside is basically a prison for the toys, and Lotso isn't a benign patriarch, he's a bitter "Mr Big" type. His chief enforcer is Big Baby, a baby dolly whose only utterances are cute baby noises, making it all the more sinister. Lotso even forcibly recruits Buzz by re-setting him. All is not lost though, as Woody won't give up on his friends. Can he save them from this "place of ruin and despair run by an evil bear who smells of strawberries"? Taking the directorial reins here is Lee Unkrich, the co-director on Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo. Unkrich worked on the story with fellow Pixar vets Andrew Stanton and John Lasseter (the boss), but there's also some new blood here in the form of Little Miss Sunshine scribe Michael Arndt. Between them, and Pixar's enormously talented crew of designers, animators, visual effects people etc, they've crafted a film that's funny, moving, sentimental and insightful, as it maps a human life, human relationships - specifically a boy leaving home, a mother's bond with that boy - through the medium of sentient plastic toys. It gets pretty dark in places, both literally - for nocturnal prison-break sequences or moody flash-backs - and figuratively. But then, many animated family films have some pretty scary stuff in them. It's all part of the mix for powerful storytelling for children: think of the greats from the Disney back-catalogue like Snow White, Bambi and The Lion King, or more recent stuff from Studio Ghibli, like Spirited Away. Oh, and if you're a Ghibli fan, the Japanese studio's long-term relationship with Pixar is acknowledged by a nice nod here - among Bonnie's toys is a Totoro, the cuddly yet formidable forest spirit from 1988's My Neighbour Totoro\u000a.

V"You and I have a tendency towards corpulence," says Charles Laughton to Peter Ustinov in Spartacus. "Corpulence makes a man reasonable, pleasant and phlegmatic. Have you noticed the nastiest of tyrants are invariably thin?"\u000a																\u000a																If the rumours are to be believed Charles Laughton was anything but "reasonable, pleasant and phlegmatic". But if his mincing bitchiness almost led to him having his nose bloodied by Ernest Hemmingway, there's no disguising the fact this son of Scarborough was an acting heavyweight in every sense of the world. And if his work on screen never quite lived up to his storied stage career, at his best, he was right up there with Olivier, Richardson and the other English greats who swapped the West End for the West Coast.\u000a																\u000a																As with Spartacus, Witness For The Prosecution saw Laughton surrounded by people capable of shining in his considerable shadow. Tyrone Power stars as Leonard Vole, a cad accused of murdering a rich widow. The story of the age, the lure of defending Vole is too much for Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Laughton), the top defence lawyer who isn't going to let a little thing like a heart attack prevent him from hogging the limelight. If Robarts is confident of proving his man's innocence, he's as surprised as anyone when Vole's wife Christine (Dietrich) sides not with her spouse but with Torin Thatcher's prosecuting attorney.Christie, Laughton, Dietrich, Power, Wilder - there was no shortage of talent involved in bringing Witness For The Prosectuion to the big screen. The big names aren't just to be found above the title, either. Sir Wilfrid's nurse Miss Plimsoll is played by Charles Laughton's long-suffering wife Elsa Lanchester. And if the woman playing Janet McKenzie looks familiar, that's because it's Una O'Connor, Lanchester's co-star in Bride Of Frankenstein who'd also appeared in the original Broadway version of Witness For The Prosecution.\u000a																\u000a																Even amongst so many other great performances (Dietrich is particularly good as the ice-cold Christine), Laughton still stands out. Devouring the dialogue like a box of chocolates, the hefty one's Sir Wilfrid is right up there with his ripest creations. Indeed many would have rather seen him with his Oscar for this bravura turn than for his effete Henry VIII. For while Robarts is wonderful fun, the gravity and girth Laughton brings to the part means we're never able to forget that, for all the grandstanding, Sir Wilfrid is giving what might well be his last performance.\u000a																\u000a																Larger than life as Laughton might be, he never threatens to wrestle Witness from the capable hands of Billy Wilder. As for what exactly the great writer-director brings to the piece, while a lot of people could have fashioned a sturdy court-room sage from Witness For The Prosecution, only he could transform it into a great comedy-drama.

VA special meeting of minds between Kaufman (who seems to represent at least 80 per cent of the imagination in Hollywood's screenwriting gene pool) and Gondry. The fact that Jim Carrey gives the best turn of his career so far doesn't hurt either.
p304
sg4
V\u000aMichel Gondry's first collaboration with contemporary Hollywood's most original screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, was 2001's Human Nature, a film that never received a theatrical release in the UK and sat in unfavourable comparison with the films the writer made with Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation).\u000aUndeniably, Human Nature was a disappointment - primarily because it didn't capture the genius Gondry had displayed in his innovative, inventive pop promos for the likes of Björk, Massive Attack, Daft Punk and Kylie Minogue. Thankfully, that problem is rectified here. Furthermore, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind boasts a quality cast and has leading man Jim Carrey burying that irritating comic persona under a compelling piece of characterisation.\u000aCarrey plays Joel Barish, a reserved, repressed New Yorker who's at his most expressive when musing to himself or scribbling in his journal. He's a decent man, but his introspection exasperates his aggressive, extrovert girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Winslet) to the point that she's had enough. Their relationship deteriorates to such an extent that Clem takes advantage of a procedure offered by Lacuna Inc, a "revolutionary painless non-surgical memory-erasing process".\u000aWhen Joel visits Clem at work to try and make amends for a falling out they had, she doesn't recognise him. Joel only discovers the truth when friends show him a card from Lacuna informing him he's been erased from Clem's memory and shouldn't try to contact her. Heartbroken and desperate, Joel decides to try the procedure for himself, despite his incredulity. "This is a hoax right? There's no such thing as this," he says to Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Wilkinson), the genial, paternal inventor of the system.\u000aTo initiate the process, Mierzwiak's employees Stan (Ruffalo), his lover and Lacuna receptionist Mary (Dunst), and assistant Patrick (Wood) visit Joel as he sleeps. The plot thickens, however, when it transpires that Patrick has stolen Joel's personal effects from his relationship with Clem and is using them to woo her himself. Worse still, as Stan begins to erase Joel's memories, starting from the present and working backwards, Joel rediscovers the good things he had with Clem. Desperately, trapped in his own unconscious, Joel tries to stop the destruction of his memories.\u000aIt's the combination of a framing narrative, set in the real world, and the action that takes place within Joel's mind (which skitters around as our hero tries to escape deeper into his memory) that gives Kaufman and Gondry's film its most marked idiosyncrasy. As well as offering Kaufman's requisite look at the boundaries of fantasy and reality, it's also perfect for Gondry's own brand of distinctive storytelling ploys, employing some wonderfully lo-fi but amazingly clever trickery.\u000aOverlapping and cross-cutting have been a mainstay of his video work - a camera browsing round a tower block for Massive Attack's 'Protection', Kylie encountering versions of herself for 'Come Into My World', Dave Grohl segueing in and out of dreams for 'Everlong'. The devices he created and expertly exploited in the promos are expanded and honed for Eternal Sunshine, creating a unique feel as he realises Kaufman's non-chronological, consciousness/unconsciousness-inhabiting script.\u000aHowever, there's a lot more to the film than technique. Arguably, this is Kaufman's most humane work yet, presenting genuine emotional circumstances within its bizarre, semi-sci-fi scenario. There's a moving realism to Joel and Clem's romance and the problems they face in their relationship - ordinary stuff like settling into routines, communicating in different ways, being distanced by things unsaid, as well as the heavier implications of mental illness. Human Nature was arguably overwhelmed by its wackiness, and even Being John Malkovich is unsubtle in comparison with Eternal Sunshine. It's a slow-burner initially, but ultimately a gentle, tender portrayal of relationships and a remarkable romantic comedy.\u000a

VAlan Moore started writing 'V For Vendetta' in the summer of 1981 during a holiday on the Isle Of Wight. Seven years later, in the winter of 1988, Moore and artist David Lloyd finally completed the graphic novel. They had set out to create a uniquely British comic book, drawing in their political pessimism toward the rise of Margaret Thatcher, literary influences such as George Orwell and Aldous Huxley, as well as more impressionistic pop culture, David Bowie, Judge Dredd and "the atmosphere of British Second World War films". It was the artist's idea to throw Guy Fawkes into the mix, suggesting the Catholic plotter should be celebrated for attempting to blow up the Houses Of Parliament.  Alan Moore wrote against a 1980s backdrop of riots, AIDS, Clause 28, and The Bomb. In updating 'V For Vendetta' for the 21st Century, the Wachowski brothers and director James McTeigue prod us with references to the War On Terror, the orange jumpsuits of Camp X-Ray, the hooded prisoners of Abu Ghraib and clips of news channels stoking up fear of bird flu, the patina of panic nation sprayed upon a sci-fi action movie that, at times, clunks around with its trousers full of spanners.  Is V For Vendetta revolutionary? Is it, as Mark Kermode noted in 'The Observer', deserving of a charge for sedition? "Violence can be used for good... for justice," insists V (Hugo Weaving), the masked and caped terrorist hero, operating way outside the usual platitudes. Martin Luther King and Gandhi are off the agenda. After rescuing Evey (Natalie Portman) from some nastiness involving a gang of Fingermen - the SS of this future state, with grimy macs instead of Nazi regalia - V takes her into his secret lair, a shadow gallery, where he keeps all the culture forbidden by the far right government led by Adam Sutler (Hurt).The Shadow Gallery is just one of numerous aspects faithfully adapted from Moore and Lloyd's original comic. The set is dressed with the same Wurlitzer juke box, the same pre-Raphaelite paintings as the comic. A stunning opening sequence where V conducts the destruction of the Old Bailey, then storms the media centre of BTV are two action sequences storyboarded in the original, albeit appearing out of order.  Also true to the comic, we never see the face beneath V's grinning Guy Fawkes mask. Unfortunately, the early expository scenes struggle under this constraint. Perhaps monologues from a masked man will never work on the screen - certainly, Portman's stilted responses are unhelpful, a return to her Queen Amidala enunciation from the Star Wars prequels.  Appalled by V's unapologetic terrorism, Evey escapes into the arms of Gordon, a powerful and famous TV presenter played by Stephen Fry (one wonders if Fry was ghostwriter on a few of V's fruitier speeches; at the end of one particularly verbose monologue, I expected the terrorist to hand out BAFTAs). In a senseless sequence, Gordon confesses to Evey his dark secret. He is gay. Worse, he keeps a shadow gallery of his own, containing a forbidden copy of the Koran. He has a lot to hide. So it's a shock when, in the next scene, he is hosting a broad satire against the fascists, backed by the Benny Hill theme tune. They haul him away. It is not so much a bum note as an entire piano of them tossed from a high window.The Wachowskis deserve credit for their ingenious backstory to this adaptation. In the original, it was an atomic war abroad that facilitated the rise of the fascists. Here it is an act of biological terrorism that may also be a corporate coup d'etat, a nudge and a wink at the military-oil axis that ascended to power in America behind President Bush. Although, in this near-future, America is written off as basically a "giant leper colony", it is very much the target of this film; essentially America is attacked through the oblique strategy of disguising the Bush regime as a British one. This makes V For Vendetta a troubling, if deliciously irresponsible experience for a UK audience - the sensibilities of the British establishment are laid into without a second thought, committing the kind of heresies that, 20 years ago, would have had MI5 ransacking the edit suite.  Climaxing with a London Underground train packed full of homemade explosive, a mere six months after the terrorist attacks of 7/7, it makes you wonder why Hollywood considers British sensibilities so robust. Or do they just not care? How long will we wait for a sci-fi film that ends with the terrorist heroes flying a 747 into the Pentagon? One suspects the forthcoming 9/11 movies like Flight 93 and Oliver Stone's World Trade Center may hold off the anarchist grandstanding. After the rousing revolutionary climax of V For Vendetta, a powerful piece of action movie filmmaking with all manner of rebellious badges pinned to its lapel, one is struck with two shocking thoughts; one, Guy Fawkes DID have a point and two, Britain is such a meaningless speck of a country that a major Hollywood action movie can blow up its symbols of power and expect the audience to join in the cheers. If there is a sequel, expect V to take the Queen from behind while shooting the Royal Family in alphabetical order.

VWith their impressive debut Bound, which was part taut thriller, part glossy advertisement for lesbianism, the Wachowski brothers announced themselves as a team to watch. But no one could have expected that they would come up in their second offering with something as extraordinary as this.  The film is a perfect product of its time. It is a very modern conspiracy thriller, a film based, like The Truman Show, on the appealingly terrifying notion of a universal conspiracy - that life itself and everything that we know and take for granted are lies. It's also a film steeped in the traditionals of Japanese anime and megamixed philosophy and semiotics (spot the Baudrillard references kids).  Reeves, in one of the rare roles suited to his strictly limited but winsome talents, is a computer geek and renegade hacker "Neo" living in a drab future-world. He is haunted by an uneasy feeling that things are not all they seem and soon finds out just how right he is. He has, or may have, a very special talent. The bad guys, headed by a spooky Weaving, want to get their hands on him, and so do the good guys, led by Fishburne in outstanding form as mentor figure Morpheus. It's the latter's team to Neo hooks up with, having his reality shattered as he does.   What ensues is an extraordinary exercise - at once familiar and innovative, it's a science-fiction adventure packed with conflict (of the enhanced chop-socky variety, supervised by Yuen Wo Ping) and spectactle that would be instantly iconic.

V\u000aEllar Coltrane spent a great deal of his young life making \u201cBoyhood.\u201d\u000aProbably one of the most unusual coming of age films you\u2019ll ever hope to see. \u201cBoyhood\u201d is the story of a single-parent family, a mother and her two children, made over a 12-year period using the same actors and director. Amazing concept. And, even more amazing that Richard Linklater pulled it off. The Houston filmmaker assembled his cast and crew annually for twelve years to tell the story of a boy growing up in Texas. It begins with the child in first grade and ends with him making new friends in college. In fact, the last few spoken words of this film I will remember for the rest of my life. The cinematic journey is rewarding and markedly profound.\u000aAs you might expect, \u201cBoyhood\u201d drops in on its characters annually. In 2002, six-year-old Mason Evans, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) overhears his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) arguing with her boyfriend about improving her life. She takes Mason and his older sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston so she can finish college, get a higher-paying  job and make a better living for her family.\u000aThe next year Mason\u2019s biological father (Ethan Hawke) drops into their lives after returning to Texas from Alaska. Mason Sr. also has some growing up to do. And, that\u2019s one of the things you like about \u201cBoyhood,\u201d it isn\u2019t just about the boy. All of the characters created by Linklater progress, some faster than others, over the 12-year span. Olivia repeatedly fails in relationships, but she\u2019s learning. Mason\u2019s father matures right in front of your eyes and becomes more responsible. Samantha has a rebellious nature, at times, but is always moving forward. These people may not be exactly like your own family, but you know them nevertheless. The emotions feel very real.\u000aPatricia Arquette plays Olivia Evans in \u201cBoyhood,\u201d the story of young man growing up in Texas.\u000aOn the negative side, Linklater\u2019s film often lacks focus. The scripts were written year-by-year. Very little was determined from the start, just some character traits and the film\u2019s impressive last scene. At times, you feel like you\u2019re on a casual stroll through these people\u2019s lives. The authenticity gets mundane at times.\u000aThe film\u2019s 2:45 runtime is another negative tick. The mind begins to wander at times. The annual segments needed trimming. Where? How much? If I knew for sure, I would be making films, not commenting on them.\u000aThe performances are nicely understated. Coltrane\u2019s laid back acting style contributed greatly to the film\u2019s truthfulness. Arquette\u2019s naturalistic approach gave the movie its heart and soul. She repeatedly fails in her personal relationships, but not with her children. They survive because of her soul-searching and good intentions. Overall, a great ensemble.\u000aFinally, is \u201cBoyhood\u201d one of the best films of 2014? Certainly, it\u2019s a great film. And, many critics have it at the very top of their lists. Personally, I like Richard Linklater so much that I hope he hasn\u2019t peaked. Maybe \u201cBoyhood\u201d is just a warm-up for something even more remarkable.

V\u000a\u000a\u000aBoyhood is a staggering cinematic achievement, all the more so in how readily you\u2019ll lose yourself in this broadly sketched tale of a life rather than pick apart how it has been uniquely assembled. For twelve years Richard Linklater has been shooting episodically, striking gold all over the place in the process \u2013 most notably in the form of Ellar Coltrane, whose lead performance as Mason is what this ambitious project hinges upon.\u000aFollowing Mason from childhood through adolescence, Boyhood doesn\u2019t just capture this young man\u2019s physical and personal growth, but that of the key figures that orbit him: separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke); sister (Lorelei Linklater); and first love (Zoe Graham). While Arquette\u2019s performance is a standout, Linklater conjures emotive, naturalistic performances from all his cast, so as the film works its magic and the years pass by, one can\u2019t help but be captivated by the lives unfolding onscreen.\u000aThat\u2019s all the more impressive with Boyhood, for the most part, avoiding making the obvious dramatic moves we\u2019re conditioned to expect in film. One might anticipate seeing Mason\u2019s emotional highs and lows unfold in traditional fashion, but more often than not these pivotal moments take place offscreen, the audience left to ponder the ripples they leave on Mason and his family across time. That this forward momentum is conveyed more through the years\u2019 contemporary music and the physical changes of Boyhood\u2019s cast is another contributing factor to the film\u2019s unforced feeling as it moves along at a pace of its own. Linklater casts a spell that defies you to not be moved, and captures the incredible complexity, richness and emotion of every one of our unique lives in the process.\u000a\u2018Boyhood\u2019 Movie Times\u000a\u000a

V\u000aMatt Lankes/The New York Times Syndicate/Redux\u000aYears ago, in a university survey of American cinema, a professor prefaced a screening of Robert Altman\u2019s ambling epic Nashville with a bracing admonition, something to the effect of, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like Nashville, you should have serious misgivings about what you want out of a motion picture.\u201d Being told to like something can feel a bit hectoring. But some films just may demand that sort of line-in-the-sand passion. Boyhood, the latest from American filmmaker Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, Bernie, School Of Rock), is one. It\u2019s a film this writer has watched, twice now, largely behind a mist of tears provoked by the film\u2019s grace notes of fuzzy adolescent nostalgia.\u000aPlenty has been made of Boyhood\u2019s production. Linklater gathered his cast for a few weeks a year over the course of more than a decade, mapping the adolescence of a Texan boy named Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) in close to real time. The boy\u2019s aging is marked as much by the acne flecking his face as by progressing pop cultural references (Dragonball Z, Harry Potter, Halo) and political movements (Bush\u2019s Fallujah invasion, the Obama-Biden ticket). Imagine Michael Apted\u2019s Up Series (documentaries that catch up with 14 British people every seven years) crossbred with Linklater\u2019s own meandering day-in-the-life surveys (Dazed and Confused, Slacker, the Before trilogy) and you begin to get a sense of the scale of the accomplishment.\u000a\u201cBecause it\u2019s such a conceptual effort,\u201d Malcolm Harris writes in the online magazine The New Inquiry, \u201cit seems almost unfair to judge Boyhood as a narrative feature.\u201d But arguing that Boyhood is something other than a conventional movie, discounting it as \u201cconceptual,\u201d glosses over what Linklater has achieved. In a film that moves without contrivance with the young man at its centre, nothing and everything happens. Characters learn lessons and grow up and go camping and shoot guns and fall in and out of love\u2014Patricia Arquette, as Mason and Samantha\u2019s upwardly mobile single mom, cycles through husbands, her desire for security drawing her to a string of abusive drunks. Linklater lets these things happen at the unhurried pace of time itself. He even lets plot threads develop in ellipses, suggesting micro-dramas in the spaces we don\u2019t see, as when a teenage Mason Jr. argues with his dad about his rightful claim to a vintage GTO, promised to him (so he argues) in a scene we never see.\u000aIn films like School of Rock, Linklater has expressed a rare sensitivity to what one Boyhood character calls the \u201cvoluptuous panic\u201d of youth. Kids are free to drink beer and smoke pot and horse around without the hand of narrative repercussion slamming down. As in Bernie, Slacker and Waking Life, Boyhood empathizes with the oddballs that dot the periphery of a certain American adolescence: the Tourettic loners stalking the suburbs, the conspiracy theorists slumped in the booths of all-night diners, the Bible-thumping backwoods Texans more commonly rendered as no-dimensional caricatures.\u000aWatching these characters orbit in and out of one another\u2019s lives gives a sense of actually watching people\u2014not canned archetypes, but fully formed people\u2014get older. Time\u2019s movement over the film establishes an uncommon intimacy with its cast, a sense that we truly know them. It feels like a consummate work for Linklater, who has long been engrossed with the spaces people occupy, how they change over time\u2014whether in the all-night party of Dazed and Confused or the 18 years separating Before Sunrise from Before Midnight. He even has the indolent liquor-store clerk from Dazed reprise his role, suggesting that all his films take place in the same narrative world.\u000aThis proximity is the core of Boyhood, and it\u2019s more impressive than managing a cast\u2019s schedules for 10-plus years or making nine feature films while shooting it. The gimmick becomes invisible, and Boyhood feels less conceptual than classical: form and narrative in harmony. Rare is a \ufb01lm that\u2019s so bottomless in its generosity and affection.\u000a\u000a\u000a22 shares\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse BoyhoodRichard Linklater \u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000aThose who bemoan cinema circa 2014 for being out of ideas: prepare to meet your match. Richard Linklater, director of the peerless Before triptych (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight) has here hit upon a no-brainer conceit that all but renders its generic compatriots obsolete. But the magic of Boyhood's high concept behind-the-scenes idea - to reform the cast and crew periodically over 12 years, thereby crafting a literal, \u2018before your very eyes\u2019 type of coming-of-age movie - lies in the many ways that Linklater harnesses the period and passing of time into his very unique project.\u000aBoyhood drops in on Mason (Ellar Coltrane) roughly once every few months over the course of a dozen years, seeing him grow from kid to teen to adult alongside his separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke), his sister (Linklater\u2019s daughter, Lorelei) and a supporting cast of friends and step-family. To start, Coltrane is not a precocious child actor, cutting more of an unassuming, naturalistic figure in early scenes of sky-gazing and rock-collecting; but over the years Mason grows from shy kid into a bona fide Linklater youth, the sort the director nailed in Dazed & Confused and Slacker, always ready with a laconic stare and a rambling philosophical rant. As with most real-life kids, though, Mason\u2019s world is framed, shaped and structured by his parents, but watching the years melt away puts the audience in a unique spot, so that when he finally, in his teens, starts to develop a life of his own - and he receives his own Linklater-trademark backwards tracking shot (think: almost every walking-and-talking scene in the Before trilogy) - we\u2019re the proud family members, amazed at how quickly he\u2019s grown up.\u000aIf Boyhood weren\u2019t centered on such compelling cinematic qualities, Linklater\u2019s scope could be called \u2018novelistic\u2019. Mason may be our anchor, but characters, themes and settings grow along with him, making this film just as much a Parenthood (Arquette\u2019s character\u2019s progression from  thirty-something single mum to successful middle-aged academic could easily be a film in its own right) or, if we\u2019re on a literal title kick, American Family, as the States\u2019 own social landscape shifts in the background of the drama, thrown into sharp relief by Linklater\u2019s episodic, observational style. From Halo to Wii Sports, from iMacs to iPhones, from Britney Spears to Lady Gaga, Boyhood is a survey of 21st-century mainstream pop culture touchstones that, due to the very nature of its production, falls somewhere between the historical and the contemporary. And as Linklater incorporates the War in Afghanistan, the groundswell of idealism that greeted Obama\u2019s first term in office, and eventually the recession, he reveals that while these events and trends may seem discrete on reflection, in reality they happen in quick succession, or sometimes all at once.\u000aThis captivating cultural cacophony is what separates Boyhood from nostalgic growing-up classics such as American Graffiti to Dazed & Confused. It\u2019s a period film in progress, where each detail, from clothes to worldview, hasn\u2019t been constructed, but is merely informed by its own context. Experimenting with his own comedy-drama formula, Linklater stretches his arms wide, to encompass Mason\u2019s world in one single, remarkable domestic epic. And, to his credit and to our benefit as film viewers, it is all within his grasp.\u000a

VJapanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa first adapted Shakespeare for the screen with Throne Of Blood in 1957, a masterful retelling of 'Macbeth' as a samurai drama. Twenty-eight years later, his eyesight failing and health deteriorating, Kurosawa announced his plans to adapt 'King Lear' as Ran. The result was one of the legendary filmmaker's most spectacular films, a terrifying epic of familial disintegration and lost honour for which Kurosawa received an honorary Academy Award.  'King Lear' is an old man's drama, so it's fitting that Kurosawa should have made it in his own dotage (he was 75 at the time of production). Excising the bard's iambic pentameter and the father-daughter theme, Kurosawa sets the tale in 16th Century Japan. Aging warlord Hidetora (Nakadai) is preparing to divide his land up between his three sons: Taro (Terao), Jiro (Nezu) and the youngest of the three, Saburo (Ryu). Refusing to take part in hypocritical professions of love for material gain, Saburo fulfils the same role as Cordelia in Shakespeare's original. As the sons bicker and argue over the division of the spoils, the aging lord is driven from his home and slowly goes mad.Kurosawa always had a keen understanding of Western art - much more so than his mentors Ozu or Mizoguchi. In Ran he presents an accomplished fusion of East and West, blending Shakespeare's play with a similarly-themed medieval samurai tale. It's stirring, evocative, thrilling stuff which flits from moments of intimate drama to epic battle sequences, all the while painting a stark portrait of the lord's descent into madness as he roams the countryside.   Shakespeare's story dealt with the loss of paternal authority and the dire consequences that resulted as Lear's kingdom was thrown into civil war and the monarch himself made to realize the universe's cruelty: "As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; they kill us for our sport". In Ran, Kurosawa uses the strict formality of the traditions of Japanese Noh drama to illustrate this collapse of form into formlessness and meaning into nothingness. As the white haired, increasingly manic Lord Hidetora (brilliantly played by Nakadai) is driven towards the brink of absolute despair, and as hundreds of cavalry soldiers charge into battle, Kurosawa provides a terrifying glimpse of the apocalypse, his camera unflinching in its depiction of the 'ran' (chaos) that the title suggests.

V\u000a"You can't stop what's coming," mutters a grizzled old-timer towards the end of No Country For Old Men. If there's a moral to be teased out of the Coen brothers' breathtaking crime thriller that could well be it. Faced with the march of time and the senseless vicissitudes of fate, the rugged characters of this Texan western noir keep pushing against the tide. It doesn't help them achieve anything... except die a little sooner.\u000aStripping back Cormac McCarthy's elegiac western, the Coens have produced one of their finest films. It's reminiscent of their early neo-noir Blood Simple and their much-lauded Oscar-winning Fargo yet it has an epic sweep that puts both of these films in the shade. As it cuts between three main protagonists, it builds a mythic, sometimes operatic, picture of America's dark soul.\u000aThe ostensible hero is Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a Vietnam vet who stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong while hunting antelope in Texas. Snaffling a suitcase stuffed with $2 million in hard cash, Moss goes on the run. Little does he realize that the suitcase is fitted with a tracking device. Following its signal is hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) armed with a cattle stun gun and a menacingly calm demeanour. Pursuing them both is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a disillusioned policeman despairing of America's violent tradition.\u000aOpening with Chigurh murdering a police deputy who's taken him into custody, No Country For Old Men quickly establishes its offbeat credentials. "I got it under control," the deputy boasts on the telephone before being brutally strangled by his handcuffed prisoner. Bardem, icily detached and decked out with a moptop wig, moves with the grace of a trained athlete. He is a man who lives to kill, an instrument of fate.\u000aAfter the struggle, the Coens focus their camera on the scuffmarks left on the linoleum floor by the deputy's boots as he thrashed and struggled. It sets the tone: vicious violence is repeatedly accompanied by bathetic black humour. No one's laughing, though. Instead the offbeat asides add to the general sense of life's absurdity that laces this thriller.\u000aFate is against everyone here; nothing ever turns out as it's supposed to, nobody ever gets quite what they wanted or deserved. Chigurh taunts his (often) innocent victims with a coin toss: heads or tails to decide whether they live or die. Most of the hicks he forces into choosing don't even realise what's at stake. There is no sense of order to the universe, just random chance. Once one realizes that, the Coens suggest, even the most everyday items seem odd: a wrapper unfolding in close up on a counter, a bottle of milk left out on a coffee table. Portents of doom are everywhere.\u000aAs the cat-and-mouse chase between Moss and Chigurh unfolds - deadly shootouts followed by graphic scenes of wounds being sewn up - the Coens drag us repeatedly back to Sheriff Bell. As in the novel, he's the conscience of the story, a man who casts a weary eye over the state of the world and is dismayed by what he sees (a newspaper report about an old couple who tortured and killed their aging lodgers prompts a dry response: "I don't why they did it; maybe the TV was broken").\u000aWith a face as craggy as the film's haunting desert landscape, Jones delivers an Oscar-worthy turn (no mean feat in a movie ripe with standout performances). Always one step behind the action, Bell eventually resigns himself to the inevitable play of fate, violence and death that America was built on. A throwaway story about an Indian raid in 1907 hints at the dark truth of the title: America is no country for old men, pacifists or moralists. It's a land for those immune to the pricks of conscience and willing to be pushed around by the hand of fate.\u000aIn a nutshell: With its sly wit, dark intelligence and tense action sequences this film  re-establishes the Coens as two of American cinema's most talented  directors. It's also the best adaptation of McCarthy's work to date and  an unmissable crime movie.\u000aBy Jamie Russell\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000aRon Howard\u2019s Rush is an exuberant, diverting dramatisation of the legendary rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) over the course of the fateful Grand Prix season of 1976. Its combo of hair-raising behind-the-wheel action, heated off-track controversies and stormy relationship soap is hardly earth-shattering stuff, but Howard and writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) do squeeze sufficient dramatic tension out of the opponents\u2019 wildly different temperaments, while acknowledging their shared sense of purpose and conviction. Hunt is the blonde-and-blue-eyed Brit, a hard-partying, hot-headed playboy with raw driving talent to spare; Lauda, on the other hand, is a brusquely pragmatic Austrian who doesn\u2019t have time for social frivolities, single-mindedly focused on the race to a fault.\u000aHemsworth and Brühl are both terrific, portraying the escalating competitive ribbing between the pair with good humour and genuine passion. Predictably, the women get sidelined: Olivia Wilde is wasted as Hunt\u2019s model girlfriend Suzy Miller, Joséphine de La Baume\u2019s role as Lauda\u2019s wife ultimately reduced a series of wordless glances, which admittedly, she does remarkably well. Technically, Howard doesn\u2019t do anything that John Frankenheimer didn\u2019t already achieve with Grand Prix back in 1966, but some of it sure is dang pretty: armed with Dogme veteran/regular Danny Boyle cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, Rush\u2019s racing sequences are gussied up with expressionistic splashes of hot, saturated colour that heighten the nerve-rattling, feverishly adrenalised view from inside the cockpit.\u000a\u2018Rush\u2019 Movie Times\u000a\u000a

V\u000aIt's fair to say that the motor racing film hasn't generally been the most distinguished of movie genres. It was arguably only with Asif Kapadia's 2010 documentary masterpiece Senna that moviegoers' eyes were really opened to the intense human drama so often on display throughout the history of Formula One \u2013 and to the fact that there might actually be something significant and universal lurking underneath the fast-paced, glamorous surface.\u000aAs good as Senna was, however, there still remained the question of whether a scripted drama could actually bring these elements out as well. Who better to have a go, then, than scriptwriter Peter Morgan - a widely acknowledged master of getting to the nub of conflicts between hard-edged, real life personalities - and his Frost/Nixon collaborator Ron Howard?\u000aThe Hunt and Lauda feud that ran throughout the 1976 season is a goldmine for Morgan, presenting him as it does with two almost diametrically opposed personalities \u2013 and yet, with each as fascinating as the other, and both equally able to inspire empathy alongside disapproval, the script never resorts to painting one as the hero or villain. Instead, the narrative shifts between them as they make their respective ways to F1 before doing battle on track in that fateful year.\u000aThere's possibly a slight bias shown towards Lauda, mind, whose cold and undiplomatic exterior is gradually peeled back thanks in part to his remarkable recovery from his accident, and to a romantic subplot that feels warmer than Hunt's ill-fated marriage to model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde). It also helps the Austrian's case that Daniel Brühl's performance is as remarkable it is \u2013 he inhabits Lauda, who remains a high-profile presence on the F1 circuit, in an uncanny fashion, making him a more compelling figure than may seem at first glance.\u000aThe racing sequences are, for the most part, astonishing. Howard makes the cars a true extension of the drivers, sending the camera in and around their clattering metal frames and the limbs of their pilots alike and conveying a true sense of both tangible weight and speed. Phenomenal sound design helps with this \u2013 it's an unrelenting assault on the ears that simply demands to be experienced on the largest screen possible.\u000aBy its very nature, F1 is a slightly unreal world, so it's to Howard's immense credit that he gets such a visceral sensation across, giving the film's closing scenes a tension that knots the stomach, whether or not you happen to know the eventual outcome. The only question, by that stage, is which of Rush\u2019s two equally fascinating heroes \u2013 or, perhaps, anti-heroes \u2013 you\u2019ve decided to root for.\u000a

VRussell Crowe gets the chance to act his heart out in Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind. Not only does he portray a maths genius (based on real life Nobel Prize-winner John Forbes Nash Jr), he portrays a maths genius crippled by schizophrenia. And he ages 47 years! He turns in a chunky, twitchy performance which, though not on a par with his more subtle turn in The Insider, is admirable. He is complemented by a less flashy, underwritten turn from Jennifer Connelly.  Princeton, 1947. Awkward but arrogant John Nash arrives on a maths scholarship, determined to come up with an original idea. Not bothering with classes, he obsessively writes theorem (plotting the movements of pigeons, for example). His only friend is raffish roommate Charles (Bettany), a rich source of wisecracks - "Officer, I saw the driver who hit me - his name was Johnny Walker" - and moral support. Eventually Nash comes up with a revolutionary paper that wins him a position at MIT. It's here that his eccentricities give way to madness. Although he marries beautiful student Alicia (Connelly), the top-secret code-breaking work he is apparently doing for the government - represented by Ed Harris' mysterious agent - pushes him to breaking point. Full-blown paranoid schizophrenia erupts and Nash is hospitalised, his reality a mess of mania and imagination. Three decades of struggle ensue.Although the film leaves out the seedier elements of the real Nash's life (divorce, cottaging), it fashions a loose biopic that is by turns funny, exciting, sad and downright corny. The script, by Akiva Goldsman, (who also wrote the inexcusable Batman & Robin), is riddled with pithy, but occasionally clichéd, utterances that capture these shifting tones: there's Nash's description of himself: "I'm quite well balanced - I have a chip on both shoulders" - or the description his doctor, Rosen (Plummer), later uses to describes his disease to his wife: "The nightmare of schizophrenia is not knowing what's true."  Although it dallies with Cold War thriller elements, A Beautiful Mind is ultimately a formulaic tale of human perseverance, and merits comparisons with other, similar award-showered tales: notably Shine. As such, it's an above-average weepie, a Hollywood prestige film that pre-packages the sufferings of one highly intelligent man and the woman who loves him to manipulate the emotions. Although the film itself is not as smart as it imagines itself to be, it's certainly artful, with fine camera work by Roger Deakins (who shot the Coens' stylish The Man Who Wasn't There), and solid, thanks to Howard's even-tempered direction.

VThe third and final film in director Leone's notional trilogy of movies about the birth of modern America, which began with the iconic Once Upon A Time In The West and continued with A Fistful of Dynamite  (which Leone later explained was originally to have been titled 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico').  Spanning 40-odd years, Once Upon A Time In America follows a clutch of Jewish immigrant gangsters from their days as excitable juvenile delinquents in Brooklyn, through the Prohibition era and into their dotage. Focussing principally on philosophical Noodles (De Niro) and his lethal partner Max (Woods), over the course of three and a half hours Leone charts their changing fortunes and fluctuating loyalties as first they have everything to play for, then everything to lose. En route there's jail, betrayal, opium and murder but through it all Noodles and Max remain bound by the dreams they shared as kids - dreams that sometimes sustain them, and other times threaten to destroy them.Any simple description of the plot fails to convey the complexity of the various relationships, or the fragmented nature of the story - a brilliantly structured mosaic of memories drawn together by the symbol of a ringing telephone, echoing down the years.   Shot with a beautiful, fluid grace, it's a patient piece of filmmaking and Leone invests these characters with a vivid inner life. But it's also a bitter, brutal story in which the characters' ambition is overshadowed by violence, and greed wins out over love. De Niro, whose character ages around thirty years, gives a solid, thoughtful performance but it's Woods who's the firecracker here.   Sad and vast yet compelling throughout, this remain Leone's most towering achievement.

But where Moonrise was awash with wistful nostalgia in its take on adolescence, romance and scouting, Anderson\u2019s latest mines its period setting in service of a broadly comical tale which enjoys frequent diversions into both black and off-colour humour even as a body count amasses and the Second World War threatens to intrude on the borders of the titular hotel\u2019s fictitious homeland.\u000aThe cast list deceptively points to another sprawling ensemble effort, but despite the bountiful number of familiar faces on display and the amount of wandering in time and aspect ratio the film does, its arguably the most fixed around an individual performance of any Anderson pic since Rushmore.

From the Vietnam pyrotechnics of the school play in Rushmore, to the pup-tent puppy love of Moonrise Kingdom, Anderson gift-wraps his stories as worlds within worlds, homemade pageants of kooky artifice. And he seems blissfully immune to trends. While Hollywood doubles down on the manifest destiny of 3D, Anderson perversely flattens cinematic reality into confectionary dioramas, mille feuille layers of faux naïf make-believe.\u000aWith every film, the art house becomes his dollhouse. His movies seem to take place in an alternate reality, a world that is as Andersonian as Cronenberg\u2019s is Cronenbergian. It\u2019s an acquired taste, one that I began to un-acquire somewhere between the Gotham bubble of The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and the Nemo-on-acid odyssey of The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004). By the time an all-too-prescient Owen Wilson popped up as bandaged suicide survivor in the railway escapade of The Darjeeling Limited (2007), I felt Anderson had lost his way. It\u2019s not just that the pick-up-sticks narrative was so archly contrived; it presented such a maze of tones and tangents that it was hard to get grip on the characters, or believe they were anything more than the constructs of an over-active imagination.\u000aWith the exhilarating romp of The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), all of a sudden the director found his groove\u2014by making a cartoon weirdly lifelike, rather than making life weirdly cartoon-like. Then, with Moonrise Kingdom (2012), it all came together. He emerged from a career of smoke and mirrors to craft an off-kilter coming-of-age tale that was unusually grounded. Instead of building the story around adults acting like children, for once he gave us children acting like adults, juvenile eccentrics playing house on a wild frontier. And even though their elopement was acted out in a mock Godard fantasy camp, the narrative framed tender moments of precocious romance with compositions that popped like still-life tableaux.\u000aIn The Grand Budapest Hotel, Anderson\u2019s eighth feature, the director invests his trademark whimsy with spectacular ambition, and the result is the most richly entertaining film of his career. It\u2019s certainly his most extravagant\u2014in the scale of its cast, its staging and its story. Composed with the cut-gem focus of Moonrise Kingdom and fired with the zany, kinetic spirit of Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel can be seen as an organic extension of his previous work. But his universe expands dramatically: the windows of this hotel are thrown wide open onto to a larger world.\u000aSaoirse Ronan in \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel\u2019\u000aThis hyper-stylized caper movie could give Baz Luhrmann a run for his money. It was inspired by Vienna\u2019s Stefan Zweig, a famous writer and dandy from the first half of the 20th century, who counted Freud among his friends, and who, according to biographer George Prochnik, wore alligator shoes, wrote with violet ink and wrote an essay about Handel that he had printed entirely on silk.\u000aIn his spirit, the movie and its hero\u2014an over-cultured concierge played with breathtaking panache by Ralph Fiennes\u2014are ridiculously ornate. The Grand Budapest Hotel is, of course, not in Budapest. The story is centred in a fictional spa town in a made-up Alpine country called Zubrowka, which seems to float between a distant belle époque and the Nazi and Stalinist scourges of the 1930s. But Zubrowka also recalls any number of imaginary places of cinematic delirium, from the Marx brothers\u2019 Freedonia (Duck Soup) to Guy Maddin\u2019s Mandragora (Twilight of the Ice Nymphs). In its broad hotel corridors, there is even a glimmer of The Shining. And Anderson says he took some cues from the pre-Code comedies of the 1930s. But once again, the world he creates is uniquely his own.\u000aWillem Dafoe (left) and Adrian Brody in \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel\u2019\u000aThe story unfolds as a nested-doll narrative that spans three generations, each framed with its own aspect ratio. We run through a declension of storytellers, from the author (Tom Wilkinson) to the young writer (Jude Law) to a mysterious patron of the hotel named Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), our chief raconteur, who takes us back to the day he was recruited as a hotel lobby boy (Tony Revolori) by the flamboyant Gustave (Fiennes).\u000aWhat triggers the action is the sudden death of an 84-year-old dowager countess named Madame D (Tilda Swinton), one of Gustave\u2019s most cherished paramours in a harem that seems unrestricted by age or gender. The lady leaves him a priceless painting. When Gustave and his lobby boy show up to claim it, they run afoul of Madame D\u2019s son, the villainous Dimitri (Adrian Brody), and the chase is on.\u000aThis madcap farce ricochets between world wars, and involves 16 characters, almost every one of them played by an A-list actor. They include Bill Murray (desk clerk), Edward Norton (police captain), Harvey Keitel (bald crime boss), Jeff Goldblum (Freud-like lawyer), Saoirse Ronan (Zero\u2019s sweetheart, with a birthmark that looks like a map of Mexico on her cheek), and Willem Dafoe in Gestapo-black leather (a Lurch-like killer with a Luger).\u000aSuch a thickly populated confection could easily collapse under its weight. But Anderson choreographs the action, and the comedy, with balletic precision, while a kaleidoscopic array of scenic eye candy rolls by.\u000aThe film\u2019s greatest revelation is Ralph Fiennes. Who knew that the star of The English Patient, who brought such sombre gravitas to so many period pieces, had such a light comic touch? His dialogue is a debonair as his dress, and he lets the pensées slide off his tongue with an air of wry decadence. Lines like: \u201cThere\u2019s no point doing anything in life because it\u2019s all over in the blink of an eye.\u201d Or: \u201cThere are faint glimmers of civilization in this vast slaughterhouse of what was once known as humanity.\u201d Or, even simple commands like \u201cTake your hands off my lobby boy!\u201d\u000aThis actor who once personified fascism to such chilling effect in Schindler\u2019s List, also gets to make fun of Nazis. And it\u2019s comforting to know that Nazis are once again fair game for farce.\u000a\u000a\u000a12 shares\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse Moonrise KingdomRalph FiennesThe Grand Budapest HotelWes AndersonWillem Dafoe \u000a\u000a\u000a

VWes Anderson's post-Fantastic Mr Fox whimsy hits its stride as storybook style meets thematic substance in this gorgeous, joyful, yet far from featherlight end-of-an-era yarn.
p352

V\u000aGreeted as something of a curiosity at the time, 2009\u2019s stop-motion animation Fantastic Mr Fox signalled a new phase in the career of aesthete-cum-filmmaker Wes Anderson. Moonrise Kingdom (2012) picked up where Fantastic Mr Fox left off, transposing the warm, earthy tones and Davy Crockett hats into the live-action sphere, while marrying Anderson\u2019s esoteric obsessions (immaculate frame composition, retro soundtracks, period trappings) to a charming tale of young love. But where The Grand Budapest Hotel most markedly differs from its predecessors - and, in fact, the bulk of Anderson\u2019s work to date - is that it looks beyond the director\u2019s distinctively aesthetic concerns and tackles larger themes.\u000aA nested story-within-a-story structure situates us in the past while stressing the expanse of time that exists between then and now: in a gloomy, modern-day Eastern Europe, a girl reads a cute little hardback titled The Grand Budapest Hotel, written by a long-dead author; in flashback, the author (Tom Wilkinson) recites his novel to the camera; in further flashback, the young author (Jude Law) visits the titular hotel and strikes up a conversation with its owner Zero Moustafa (F Murray Abraham), who, in one final flashback that lasts for the bulk of the film, spins a yarn of hijinks and intrigue during the interwar period in the (fictional) country of Zubrowka.\u000aAt the centre of the action is concierge-supreme Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes, in a deliciously fruity semi-comic turn), whose reign as chief of the Grand Budapest Hotel cemented its reputation as an alpine retreat par excellence. In a breathless tracking shot that recalls Anderson\u2019s cheeky commercial for American Express, Gustave is seen ploughing through the hotel overseeing every element of its smooth running, right down to the guests\u2019 nail polish, exemplifying an aesthetic fastidiousness that even Anderson newcomers will recognise as an extension of the director\u2019s own auteurist attention to detail.\u000aBoth Anderson and Gustave\u2019s impressive faculties are pushed to the limit by the film\u2019s twisty plot, which is replete with high-speed chases, prison breakouts, secret societies, stolen paintings, assassins, fascists and dead dowagers. It\u2019s the sort of derring-do that recalls the caper-filled adventures of Belgian boy-wonder Tintin, with Gustave and young Zero (Tony Revolori) high-tailing it from one sticky situation to another. Anderson\u2019s stylised approach (not to mention Adam Stockhausen\u2019s picture-postcard production design) perfectly matches his zest for storytelling, and he\u2019s able to keep the peppy pace going while providing a whistle-stop tour through a superb cast of cameos, including appearances from the likes of Tilda Swinton, Mathieu Amalric, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Willem Dafoe and Lea Seydoux.\u000aBut The Grand Budapest Hotel is more than just a character-filled chamber piece or a stylistic tour-de-force; the story of Zero, Gustave and their august institution is a paean to both an era and a social order that were completely eradicated by the 20th Century\u2019s hot and cold wars. The \u2018enchanting old ruin\u2019, as the older Zero calls it, is as much a relic for a bygone age as it is a touchstone for certain qualities also lost - a decadence, perhaps, but also a strict, yet generous propriety best epitomised by Gustave himself.\u000a

VIngmar Bergman's haunting masterpiece explores the gulf of communication that exists between a nurse and her silent patient.
p355
sg4
VA claustrophobic drama with only four characters and only two sets, Persona is a stunning example of cinematic innovation. Charting the neurotic relationship between a nurse and her mute patient, Ingmar Bergman's multi-faceted film is at once a psychological drama, a philosophical meditation on the gap between art and reality, and a curious love story.\u000aAfter forgetting her lines in the middle of a performance, theatre actress Elisabeth Vogler (Ullman) retreats from the world, refusing to speak to anyone and becoming a patient at a Swedish sanatorium. With the help of a young nurse (Andersson), she takes a holiday cottage on the coast in order to recuperate, but their intense, brooding interaction leads only towards madness and despair. A film of flayed nerves and unspoken anxieties, Persona offers a distressing portrait of emotional and spiritual desolation from which Bergman's claustrophobic camera offers no hope of escape. Eschewing establishing shots in favour of a series of striking compositions in which the two lead actresses are forced to share a limited amount of screen space, Bergman tries to make the ever-increasing insanity of his protagonists affect the audience as well. Disorienting us with jump cuts and self-reflexive moments (a shot of a projector, a camera crew and - in a startling sequence - a sequence where the film literally collapses, burning a hole in the negative) this is an unsettling piece of cinema.  The characters' angst-ridden experience of what one calls "the hopeless dream of being" coupled with Bergman's transgression of the conventions of film production create a haunting nightmare of madness and despair. As much a response to the political insanity of the mid-1960s (a television set shows Vietnamese monks immolating themselves) as a film about nervous breakdowns, Persona is a rich, allegorical work that rewards repeated viewings.\u000a \u000aThe small boys progress though the desolate hotel corridors, sparsely  populated by freaks and eccentrics, provided a blueprint for much of  Stanley Kubrick's work in the hotel corridors of The Shining. Yet  even that reclusive miserablist failed to achieve this sense of  alienation and despair. Bleak and immensely powerful, it is among the  most disturbing of Bergman's works.\u000a \u000a \u000aRead reviews of other Ingmar Bergman films screening on Film4 from 4th to 17th July 2011\u000aGo to TV listings

VBrowse our reviews of other arresting directorial debuts\u000a \u000aWho is Donnie Darko? Well, he's the troubled hero of Richard Kelly's remarkable debut feature, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Not only is Donnie ("Donnie Darko? What the hell kinda name is that?") a complex character - he's a high IQ high-school student, troubled by mental instability, who is both frank and perspicacious - but the film itself defies genre definition. It's a drama about teen love. It's philosophical sci-fi. It's a satire of 80s America. And more.  It's 1988. Donnie wakes up on a mountain road. It looks like Provence, but Donnie soon descends into manicured all-American suburbia. The film was shot in LA but the fictional setting of Middlesex, Virginia, is reminiscent of Blue Velvet or even E.T. (further evoked by the presence of Barrymore, who executive produced and co-stars as a teacher). These connections - and explicit references within the film to Back To The Future, The Evil Dead and The Last Temptation Of Christ - are all part of Kelly's dense weave, contributing to the film's themes of 80s culture, time travel, the supernatural (Donnie is visited repeatedly by a eerie, man-sized 'rabbit' called Frank - a nod to Harvey) and faith.\u000aQuestions of faith are played out not only through the fundamentalist  undercurrents in Donnie's community (a repressed teacher insists on  banning Graham Greene's 'The Destructors' on the grounds that it  encourages youth violence), but also in the form of a self-help guru,  Jim Cunningham (Swayze). Donnie's frustration pours out when he's  confronted by this man, who simplistically reduces emotion to a struggle  between fear and love. It's a potent stand-off, between reductive  quasi-philosophy from Cunningham (the product of a cynical, quick-fix  commercial culture) and straightforward wisdom from the "troubled and  confused" Donnie.  As with Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, another product of a young auteur, Donnie Darko is brimfull of ideas. However, Kelly's film focuses on one character,  has a sci-fi dimension and an 80s milieu - which is thankfully created  with sensitivity (no naff wardrobe, plenty of decent period music) and  satirical humour (Dukakis versus Bush Sr forms a backdrop).\u000aDonnie Darko is a well-made film, without tangible low-budget  problems (it cost $4.5 million). It's shot with grace and atmosphere,  directed with assurance and expertly played. Alongside star Gyllenhaal,  his sister Maggie plays his screen sister; expressive character actor  Holmes Osborne plays his bewildered dad; Oscar-nominated Mary McDonnell  plays his mum ("How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?" Donnie asks  her, "It feels wonderful" she says with despairingly cheerful love).  The cast is further bulked out by 'ER' regular Noah Wyle as Donnie's  physics teacher; upcoming actress Jena Malone as Donnie's girlfriend;  and Katherine Ross as Donnie's therapist. Ross's presence makes for  another evocative connection, to that earlier coming-of-age tale, The Graduate (in which she played Mrs Robinson's daughter).

VFrom the opening shot of a Los Angeles cityscape at night in the year 2019, it is clear that Scott has conjured up something special. Deckard (Ford) is a hardbitten 'blade runner', called out of self-imposed retirement to track down and kill four rogue androids. As he goes about his work, mostly at night, mostly in the rain, he falls in love with another android, Rachael (Young), and is forced to confront painful questions concerning his own identity.\u000a																\u000a																Adapted from science fiction genius Philip K Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', the film touches on many of Dick's favourite themes - chiefly the notions of memory and identity and how intimately entwined they are. It also exists in two quite different forms. Often the Director's Cut is a yawn-inducing act of self-obsession. When Scott came to present his own cut of Blade Runner it proved to be different to the version originally released in subtle but substantial ways. \u000a																\u000a																The Director's Cut is a few minutes shorter than the original, has the hardboiled explicatory dialogue removed and Deckard's pivotal dream of a unicorn reinstated. These differences mean that Blade Runner is in fact two of the greatest and most influential science fiction films ever made.

V\u000aMeet Mary. She's eight years old, has eyes the colour of muddy puddles and a birthmark the colour of poo. Her mother likes to cook with sherry ('tea for grown-ups') and her father, who works in a factory attaching the string to earl grey teabags, likes to spend his spare time in the shed playing with dead birds. Not your average animation heroine. But then Adam Elliot's clayography, as heralded by his Oscar-winning 2003 short, Harvie Krumpet - about an ever-optimistic Jewish WWII refugee whose lot in life includes being struck by lightning and losing a testicle - is far from your average animation.\u000aDespite certain kooky flourishes (Mary debates the provenance of babies with her fellow title character - her theory is that they come from the bottom of beer glasses, while Max has been informed they come from eggs laid by rabbis) which might, on the surface, be mistaken for cutesy, self-conscious affectation, this film is not child's play - neither in style nor in substance.\u000aAlternately heart-warming and heartbreaking, the elegiacally faltering,  drawn-out (the narrative spans several decades) pen pal relationship  between Mary and Max - an obese 40-something lapsed Jewish New Yorker  with Aspergers syndrome, whose name Mary fortuitously plucks from the  phonebook - is at bottom a canny device which provides a window on to  the interior world of two lonely, marginalised souls. Their platonic  love affair plays out like a ballroom dance between two terminally  left-footed but devoted partners - awkward, fumbling, funny and tender  all at once.\u000aPhilip Seymour Hoffman in particular deserves kudos for his brilliantly  droll, expressive voicing of Max - well, expressive insofar as a  persistent monotone, punctuated by off-kilter syntax and intonation can  be ("I live with my cat, Hal, which is short for halitosis, from which  he suffers"). So too do Adam Elliot and his 50-strong crew, whose labour  of love took 57 weeks to shoot.\u000aThe film's boldly sombre palette urges you to look for subtleties in  technique, rather simply be dazzled by the rainbow effect characteristic  of most contemporary animation. Some touches are pristinely realistic  and subtle, like the quivering of lips or the welling up of eyes on a  face about to cry (there are quite a few tears shed too - an innovative  use of sexual lubricant, a reported 2,400 teaspoons of which were used  on set). Others, like the monochrome, unwelcoming vision of Max's New  York - in which a flat black sky is coldly illuminated by white  pinpricks of stars - are abstractly poetic.\u000a

V\u000aHayao Miyazaki was still an up-and-coming talent when he wrote and directed My Neighbour Totoro in 1988. His second feature for the groundbreaking Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki hoped the film would build upon the success of his earlier offerings, the pre-Ghibli Nausicaa And The Valley Of The Wind and the Studio's debut production Laputa: Castle In The Sky.As it turned out, My Neighbour Totoro did not set the Japanese box office alight, but just as audiences eventually came around to Citizen Kane and It's A Wonderful Life, over time the public learned to love this movie. Indeed, it is now considered one of Miyazaki's greatest works, and is hailed as one of the key films that introduced Japanese animation to the English-speaking world.\u000aMy Neighbour Totoro is the story of two little girls, Satsuki and Mei (Noriko Hidaka and Chika Sakamoto respectively, or, in the English dub, real-life sisters Dakota and Elle Fanning), who travel to the country with their father. Since their new home, a weather-beaten old house, lies near to a forest, it isn't long before the sisters are exploring the clearings and tree-lined lanes. They soon discover that, despite living out in the sticks, there are plenty of neighbours closeby who have made the woodland their home - sprites, spirits and troll-like Totoros who seem to have leapt out of fantasy and fable.\u000aThe girls' adventures with their new friends are by turns enchanting and whimsical, displaying Miyazaki's unrivalled skill at transporting children's unfettered imagination, keen curiosity and sense of wonder onto the big screen. Under Miyazaki's direction, even the everyday is transformed into something fantastical, and simple chores like cleaning a dusty house and waiting for the bus in the rain are made into unforgettable moments of pure magic.\u000aHowever, My Neighbour Totoro steps back from the precipice of tweeness by rooting the film in small-scale, humanistic themes of coming of age and potential loss. The ongoing illness of Satsuki and Mei's mother, as well as the older child's responsibility for her younger sister, form a compelling backbone for a tale that could easily have drifted off on its own flights of fancy.\u000aIn a nutshell: One of the finest family films ever made. My Neighbour Totoro's mixture  of spectacular animation, endearing characters and solid,  universal  themes single it out as a true Ghibli classic, and a  contender for  Miyazaki's best work overall.\u000aBy Richard Luck\u000a

V\u000aBen Affleck has some explaining to do in \u201cGone Girl.\u201d\u000aDirector David Fincher has the gift of making people feel uncomfortable. Oh, there\u2019s always loads of suspense in his films, but never complacency. That\u2019s what I love about his movies, and \u201cGone Girl\u201d is no exception.\u000a\u201cGone Girl\u201d is a psychological thriller based on the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the screenplay. It\u2019s the breathtaking story of a husband (Ben Affleck) who\u2019s believed responsible for the kidnapping and presumed death of his wife (Rosamund Pike). Nick Dunne (Affleck) has an abrasive personality. He can be charming when he needs to be, but always seems to be hiding a sly temperament underneath. He\u2019s not always successful disguising his true nature.\u000aHis wife, Amy (Pike), is a smart and apparently upbeat woman who happily moves to Missouri with her husband, so he can be close to his dying mother. On the couple\u2019s fifth anniversary, Amy disappears from their home after an apparent struggle. Her disappearance becomes a national obsession. She was the inspiration for a series of children\u2019s books written by her father and mother.\u000aThe story progresses at a speedy clip, despite the film\u2019s 2-and-a-half hour runtime. Fincher, with Flynn\u2019s help, created a complex, logical shocker that leaves you restless, but attentive. Even when you\u2019re given significant pieces of the puzzle and an overall image of it comes into view, it\u2019s anything goes until the end.\u000aThere\u2019s an answer for everything as well. I can\u2019t remember a single thing that can\u2019t be adequately explained with just a little thought. And, for someone who\u2019s compulsively chained to logic, like myself, that\u2019s important.\u000a\u201cGone Girl\u201d has plenty to say about how the media plays a role in celebrated criminal cases. Missi Pyle is Ellen Abbott, a cable TV host based on HLN\u2019s Nancy Grace. And, yes, she is disgusting. It\u2019s a timely commentary on how high-profile crimes often get tried on tabloid television. Not pretty.\u000aThe casting is pretty much perfect. Affleck is playing a version of himself, or at least how the public and press imagine he might be. Rosamund Pike does an admirable job with her complicated character. I\u2019m not so sure it was Oscar-worthy, but she did get the nomination. And, I\u2019m okay with that. Rest of the cast does a fine job. Tyler Perry was surprisingly aces as Nick\u2019s celebrity attorney.\u000a\u201cGone Girl\u201d is yet another awesome accomplishment by one of the best directors working today.

p388

V\u000aDavid Fincher\u2019s latest film is a lot of things, but above all it\u2019s an exercise in deception. Mirroring its twisty, turny plot that tracks the disappearance of \u2018Amazing\u2019 Amy Dunne and the suspicion that falls upon her husband Nick in the aftermath, Gone Girl delivers one rug pull after another as Fincher flits from genre to genre with a reckless abandon.\u000aStarting out as a straightforward mystery before transitioning into thriller territory and then finally warping into a twisted black comedy in its tour de force final act, it\u2019s also by turns a crime drama, erotic thriller and a suburban/economic/media satire along the way. You get the sense that Fincher is constantly and very deliberately trying to wrong-foot and provoke his audience as he goes about making the most entertaining and intriguing film he can muster out of the popular, pulpy paperback.\u000aPike and Affleck are both perfectly cast as Nick and Amy, the often inscrutable protagonists of the piece, and the first half of the film follows Nick and the investigation into Amy\u2019s disappearance in the present day, while flashbacks narrated by Amy in the form of diary entries recount the history of their relationship. It\u2019s Gone Girl: Him and Gone Girl: Her until the midpoint when the two narratives collide like a pair of freight trains, but even as the facts start to emerge and the plot progresses apace the tension fails to abate. Fincher\u2019s frequent DoP Jeff Cronenworth captures proceedings in a crisp and hermetic cool grey, yet there\u2019s always the sense that we\u2019re being dragged along on our stomachs through a sordid and polluted world. It makes for a deeply unsettling and corrosive watch.\u000aThere\u2019s one explosive sequence in particular \u2013 and you\u2019ll know it when you see it \u2013 that is as well-staged as anything Fincher\u2019s done throughout his illustrious career. It\u2019s so perfectly choreographed yet captures a brief moment of presumably involuntary improvisation from Rosamund Pike (which you\u2019d bet your bottom dollar has come about thanks to Fincher\u2019s insistence on multiple takes) that\u2019s utterly imperfect and human, but in the moment plays as hilarious and spine-chilling in equal measure.\u000aGone Girl\u2019s depiction of the media can at times feel a little broad \u2013 especially when it comes to Missi Pyle\u2019s borderline libellous TV host-cum-commentator \u2013 but it\u2019s telling that it still feels fairly true to life. Fincher castigates modern news journalism for its tendency to perpetuate false narratives and make snap judgements based on limited, biased and out-of-context information.\u000aBut perhaps the film\u2019s masterstroke is delivered in its final moments when we\u2019re suddenly made to ask whether we as an audience are complicit. How well have we ever known Nick and Amy Dunne? When have we really seen their true selves? Do we ever come to truly understand what made them tick? Over 149 minutes David Fincher is like a puppet-master, provoking us into moments of empathy, repulsion and judgement. In retrospect, it seems churlish to have ever tried to form opinions based on the limited, biased and out-of-context information Gone Girl decides to divulge to us on a piecemeal basis.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a(Reader note: Spoilers follow.)\u000aThere are very few likeable people in Gone Girl, David Fincher\u2019s film adaptation of Gillian Flynn\u2019s bestselling book, which may explain its critical acclaim. Bad characters are in vogue these days: not as foils to good characters or as animate morality lessons about the dangers of drugs and crime, but as protagonists who finish first, unscathed and unrepentant. From Breaking Bad to The Wolf of Wall Street to House of Cards (the first two episodes of which Fincher directed), moral ambiguity in the movies and on TV is now a mark of sophistication and depth. By these standards, then, Gone Girl is the deepest movie ever made.\u000aThe film\u2019s protagonist, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), is an aloof, misogynistic hipster (he owns a bar called the Bar) who doesn\u2019t appear remotely distraught when his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary. He is irritated when he finds his front door wide open, his glass coffee table smashed in, and his wife mysteriously absent\u2014but he isn\u2019t scared; a sign in the minds of police and the media that he may be hiding something. Fincher\u2019s film begins as Flynn\u2019s book does, in Nick\u2019s irrefutably creepy voice. He wishes he could open his wife\u2019s \u201cfinely shaped head,\u201d he tells us, and extract some answers to the questions that \u201cstormcloud over every marriage. \u2018What are you thinking? Who are you? What have we done to each other?\u2019 \u201d Amy is a waifish, nagging, spoiled New Yorker, resentful of Nick for moving them from Manhattan to his sleepy Missouri hometown after the recession. We are to believe, based on a sequence of flashbacks and voiceovers reminiscent of Desperate Housewives (these are substitutes for Amy\u2019s diary entries in the book) that Nick and Amy were once in love, but even their tender moments are laced with foreboding.\u000aWhat makes Gone Girl, in its earlier moments, such an engaging mystery is the unreliable narration. In print and on screen, we shift back and forth between Amy and Nick\u2019s voices, equally wary of both but hopeful that their skewed versions of events will give us insight into who they are and potentially, what has become of Amy. Did Nick kill her? Or is he innocent, and simply relieved she is gone? Nick claims Amy is a demanding shrew, and Amy claims Nick is absent and angry, verging on abusive. The competing narration is evidence that marriage is a mystery unto itself, with or without a missing persons case.\u000aUnfortunately this is when Flynn, who adapted the screenplay from her book, drops the cheap, anachronistic bomb on us: Amy, it turns out, isn\u2019t merely an unreliable narrator in the same obfuscating fashion as Nick. She is an inadmissible narrator: a comically insane femme fatale whose version of events isn\u2019t sanitized to win us over, but fabricated almost in its entirety to incriminate Nick. She morphs instantly from a real person into a caricature from one of Tyler Perry\u2019s Biblical revenge allegories, a sociopath who makes false rape accusations and penetrates herself with a wine bottle in order to mimic signs of \u201cforced entry.\u201d (Ironically, Perry plays the only likeable character in Gone Girl, hot-shot defence attorney Tanner Bolt).\u000aFlynn\u2019s foray into Fatal Attraction territory has caused controversy since the book\u2019s release in 2012. Some critics accused the author, a Missouri native like her protagonist, of being anti-feminist. The limitations of film are especially unkind to Amy\u2019s character, who is \u201cstripped of her self-justification\u201d when adapted to screen, writes Amanda Dobbins in Vulture. Flynn has defended her villainous heroine by lamenting the lack of complex women characters in literature. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to acknowledge the ugly side?\u201d she writes in an essay on her website. \u201cI\u2019ve grown so weary of the spunky heroines, brave rape victims, soul-searching fashionistas that stock so many books.\u201d\u000aWell, I\u2019ve grown weary of the woman scorned. A heroine willing to set the world on fire to punish her inattentive, philandering husband is a cliché far greater and older than Eat Pray Love. Gone Girl may begin a smart and promising mystery, but it ends a misogynistic wet dream.\u000a\u000a\u000a23 shares\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse David FincherGone Girl \u000a\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000aAs a fan of Gillian Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl, the notion of David Fincher bringing her twist-laden, guilt-infused novel to the big screen was a perfect fit. Ditto for Ben Affleck\u2019s casting as the often slimy, only semi-sympathetic and sometimes ill-advisedly smirking Nick Dunne, and Rosamund Pike his missing, put-upon wife Amy. With former Entertainment Weekly TV writer Flynn herself penning the screenplay and the likes of Neil Patrick Harris, Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit, Tyler Perry and Scoot McNairy popping up amongst the supporting cast, all signs pointed to a quality adaptation and Gone Girl does not disappoint.\u000aThere\u2019s little room for Fincher-isms here. With a ton of story to get through, his directorial flourishes feel limited to precise, eerie lighting of scenes that are more pacey than he usually delivers \u2013 and for good reason, since Gone Girl feels like it moves along at a clip, yet still clocks in at 2 hours and 29 minutes. It\u2019s the most straight-forward film Fincher\u2019s made since Panic Room, and even that boasted the sort of showiness that\u2019s not on offer here. Instead the director seems content to let the narrative do the work, doing justice to the pulpy story by not getting himself between moviegoers and Affleck\u2019s perfectly-suited performance.\u000aUnexpectedly funny at times and happy to linger on its bloodiest moments, Gone Girl is perfectly capable of surprises (including blink-and-you\u2019d-miss-it shots of two leading men\u2019s junk) that punctuate Flynn\u2019s twisted tale with venomous glee. A totally different beast to Fincher\u2019s arguably unnecessary The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this superior thriller arrives at a time when Hollywood mostly seems to have forgotten how to make \u2018em.\u000a\u2018Gone Girl\u2019 Movie Times\u000a\u000a

VIn a world where most comedies have barely enough jokes to beef up the trailer, Monty Python And The Holy Grail stands apart. In fact, there are so many gags they get in the way of the other good stuff. The brilliantly-dressed sets, the painstaking attention to detail, the atmospheric Scottish landscape, the clever use of the film's one principle location (Stirling's Doune Castle) - few historical dramas are as handsome. \u000a																\u000a																For all of Hazel Pethig's costume cunning and Roy Forge Smith's design wizardry, Holy Grail will probably never be recognized for its accurate recreation of the Dark Ages. For, when all's said and done, this is a film about dismembered swordsmen, politically active peasants and knights who say "Ni!"\u000a																\u000a																That such disparate elements are woven into a (fairly) coherent story is just one aspect of Grail's genius. Another is that the film preserves the inspired formula of the Pythons' TV sketches - comprising low comedy, highbrow humour, gusto-packed musical numbers and Terry Gilliam's inimitable animation. Life Of Brian might be the (slightly) better film, but Grail is much truer to the troupe's spirit, with its tale of how Arthur (Chapman) and his men search for the cup of Christ, along the way encountering stroppy Frenchmen and an enchanter called Tim, and learning some really useful information from the man in Scene 24.\u000a																That Holy Grail is so good is all the more remarkable given how bad it could have been. Made for a pittance by two men who'd never directed a feature film before, Grail also had to overcome the small matter of nominal lead Graham Chapman's raging alcoholism. But while his drinking might have effected the way the film was shot (unable to remember his lines, Chapman's takes were invariably very short), it doesn't detract from a performance that establishes him as the real actor of the group. As for the others, they all have narrow ranges, but this isn't a problem since within their respective fields, there are few better performers. John Cleese is particularly inspired as the blood-hungry Lancelot and the French guard with a unique line in insults. ("Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!")\u000a																\u000a																This being a Python product, comedy curmudgeons will hark on about consistency. But while not everything here is 24-carat comedy gold, the fact remains that the very sketches some consider weak are the ones that make the movie for others. And whatever bum notes it might hit, Holy Grail is a film in which the word "Camelot" is rhymed with "push the pram a lot". People have been knighted for less. Just ask Tim Rice.\u000a

VThe first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is a visual assault, acclaimed as one of cinema's most accurate realisations of warfare. Captain John Miller (Hanks), a schoolteacher turned soldier, is among the US troops storming Omaha Beach on D-Day. Acting as the eyes of the audience, everyman Miller takes in the horrors of the experience: men maimed, deafened and terrified. The sequence, with its immersive, handheld cinematography, effectively carries popcorn-munching film-goers closer to the brutalities of war than they would ever choose to be.\u000a																\u000a																Subsequently our nerves settle only as far as those of the traumatized but professional Miller. Miller is called up to lead a small force ahead of the main body of troops to find one Private Ryan (Damon), the surviving brother of three soldiers killed in the same week, in a kind of humanitarian military PR gesture.\u000a																\u000a																Despite the familiar characterisations in Miller's troop (Sizemore, Burns, Pepper, Goldberg), and the dubious waving of the Stars and Stripes, Spielberg takes a traditional boy's own war story and crafts an effective, moving film.

VMugged at the 1995 Oscars by Forrest Gump, this enduringly powerful prison drama promotes the unquenchable human spirit with an intelligence that the gooey Gump readily sacrificed. Despite the film's modest performance at the box office on its first release, Frank Darabont made a major splash with his assured directorial debut.\u000a																\u000a																Adapted by the director himself from a Stephen King short story - one that appeared in the same 'Different Seasons' collection that spawned the films Stand By Me and Apt Pupil - the plot has Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a man arriving in prison in 1946 on a double life sentence for the murder of his wife and her lover. Andy is an apparently decent man with a preternaturally calm disposition, who is quietly insistent about his own innocence. \u000a																\u000a																He befriends Red (Freeman), a veteran of the penal system, and their growing friendship over 20 years forms the backbone of the film - and provides a narrative pay-off as satisfying as it is heart-warming. Using a voiceover narration, much of which is taken verbatim from King's story, the film's great triumph is its sincerity, and even those moments that might have felt mawkish - the suicide of the old lag, for example, who fails to adjust to life on the outside - achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy.\u000a																At nearly two and a half hours in length, it's a film with plenty of time on its hands yet, thanks to engagingly warm performances by Robbins and Freeman, it very rarely drags. Robbins in particular locates a deep-seated humanity in his enigmatic banker (who unexpectedly benefits from his accounting skills), while the issues that Darabont is concerned with - faith, friendship, patience and hope - are woven seamlessly into the fabric of the story. \u000a																\u000a																The director returned to Stephen King for his belated follow-up, The Green Mile, which failed to live up to the promise of his debut, replacing its warmth and subtlety with sheer bulk. Here though Darabont achieves that rarest of goals and creates a film that not only stands up to repeated viewings but which, for its legion of dedicated fans, approaches the power and significance of on-screen therapy.\u000a

Yet.\u000aI continue to have problems with the pompousness of the Capital City and the excessive sentimentality of the freedom fighters. That signals dishonesty. And, \u201cMockingjay\u201d is just loaded with spurious emotions.\u000aPart I of \u201cMockingjay\u201d is mostly about war propaganda. The rebels want to win the hearts and minds of the masses as a way to foment revolution. But, the lack of enthusiasm expressed by our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is meant to endear us to her. But, you can\u2019t BUY her emotions, damn you! She\u2019s the heavyweight hero and can\u2019t be manipulated into false emotions. I found the propaganda storyline quite absurd.\u000aAnd, speaking of silly, did you see Donald Sutherland?

V\u000a\u000a\u000aDeparting from the battle royale format of the two previous Hunger Games instalments, Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 plunges the franchise into deeper terrain. Figuratively, with the pic continuing Katniss Everdeen\u2019s trauma-fuelled mental disintegration and its subject matter becoming bleaker and more violent, as well as the literally underground setting in which much of Mockingjay\u2019s talk of revolution plays out. Against this deep bunker backdrop the cast spend a lot of time sporting unflattering jumpsuits and talking about what is to come in the next chapter, truncated storytelling that hampers this working as a standalone pic.\u000aYes, there is plenty of narrative to work through, and the performances and events that unfold deserve the breathing space that splitting Mockingjay into two films allows. But that makes for all build-up and little payoff, lacking a blockbuster set piece finale (even as it tries to make the most of a rebellion skirmish and an aerial commando raid). Thankfully there\u2019s an emotional climax, a cliffhanger that\u2019s less deflating than that of Catching Fire and will further enthuse the audience to see Part 2 - not that they really need any assistance at this point.\u000aDirector Francis Lawrence continues his knack for avoiding obvious, emotionally overwrought moments, something he\u2019s aided considerably in by Lawrence\u2019s expectedly excellent performance. The whole franchise has benefited immensely from the inner turmoil she brings to life, and no more so than here. For swathes of the film, Katniss has little to do but react to the actions of others, though she does get to blow stuff up with her bow and enjoy a literal save the cat moment. And until Part 2, that\u2019s the most you\u2019re gonna get.\u000a\u2018The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1\u2032 Movie Times\u000a\u000a

V\u000aThe most enduring image The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 offers is an eyeball-searing hell-scape of incinerated corpses, their ribs poking through blackened, immolated flesh. This is not Harry Potter, this is not the Twilight saga - The Hunger Games is here to offer an in-your-face critique of the abuse of power and neither the characters nor the material is about to shy away from the issues. Both book and film understand and want show their audience that contemporary wars are fought as much through media as they are on the battlefield. Or rather, while wars have always been fought through the media, these days the media is also in the thick of the actual fight: cameras can be sent out unobtrusively into the field to capture "the truth," though it is of course still in the interpretation of these truths that hearts and minds are won and lost.\u000aAs the film opens, we pick up with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), furious that the rebel alliance led by President Coin (a frosty Julianne Moore) plotted to save her from the Hunger Games at the expense of her more expendable companions. They counter that she is their mascot - the emblem of the revolution; they needed her to survive. As she refuses to co-operate, they realize they also need her good will. The majority of the film is about negotiating that co-operation and how to play it on camera once they finally have her onside.\u000aThe script, by Peter Craig and Danny Strong (Buffy fans may recognise Strong for his onscreen work as nerdy Jonathan Levinson), has a lot of fun with Katniss Everdeen's legendary awkwardness. Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman in his last role) attempts to media train Katniss into a serviceable mouth-piece for their cause, leading to comic scenes of desperation as he and his team realise quite what a dud screen presence she is when asked to play-act the revolution. It's a smart excuse for the narrative to take Katniss out to where the action is, which is also what we want as an audience: we need action, even if it is all being staged for our benefit.\u000aIt's hard to shake the feeling that this film doesn't have a particularly cinematic arc, and that this is partly a consequence of carving two films out of one book. There is a lot to get through in that third book, but much of it is internal and emotional, to do with how Katniss wrestles with everything that is demanded of her and with her feelings for Peeta, who is mostly restricted to brief onscreen glimpses as the Capitol cranks out its own propaganda making use of their most influential hostage. These brief glimpses of Peeta, Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) and President Snow (Donald Sutherland having more fun than anyone else in the film) really do pop - if only there were more of them.\u000aPerhaps it proves Suzanne Collins' satirical point that the absence of the Capitol in this instalment is so keenly felt. The world of Panem is named for the Latin tag "panem et circenses": the idea of using "bread and circuses" to distract a population from their lack of real freedom by giving them a glittering show. We're so used to blockbusters on this scale delivering precisely that show, it's a little disconcerting to realise that you have indeed been conditioned to miss it when it's left out in favour of something more ideologically sound. We want more of the decadent Capitol and their razzle dazzle; the revolution is a little sombre. And that's exactly how the Capitol's real life equivalents maintain their power, by making radical change seem so crashingly colourless.\u000a

VThe road to Hollywood is littered with the corpses of pop stars who've tried their hand at acting and found the world wasn't ready for their close-ups (stand up Michael Jackson, Maria Carey, Madonna). Which is probably why 8 Mile has the oddball pairing of Eminem and Curtis Hanson. Just as Dr Dre lent Marshall Mathers III credibility when he emerged onto the hip hop scene a few years ago, Wonder Boys director Hanson gives the rapper cinematic legitimacy for his big screen debut - and, man, does he come off well. \u000a																\u000a																As Rabbit, an aspiring MC from a broken home who's trying to work his way up through Detroit's black hip-hop clubs, he's essentially playing a fictionalised version of himself. However, rather than turn 8 Mile into an Eminem vanity project, Hanson and writer Scott Silver (Johns) hone the star's personality traits to create a strong, socially-aware character-driven drama.\u000a																\u000a																Like Hanson's L.A. Confidential, 8 Mile has a strong sense of place. The title refers to the street that separates Detroit's affluent white neighbourhoods from its poor black ones and Hanson - by way of Amores Perros cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto's fluid-but-raw hand-held work - brilliantly captures the chaos of a once great industrial city gone to ruin. Rabbit, or Jimmy Smith Jr (Eminem), is the nominal white kid from the wrong side of the tracks who dreams of using his MC skills to get out of Detroit's run-down 313 area. By day he works in a steel plant, at night he works on his lyrics in the trailer he shares with his boozy, bingo-addicted white-trash mother Stephanie (Basinger) and adoring six-year-old sister Lily (Greenfield). \u000a																\u000a																In the opening scenes we see Rabbit choke in front of a sea of black faces at a free-style battle hosted by his friend Future (Phifer). He scuttles off stage to catcalls of "Vanilla Ice" - something the real Slim Shady endured on his way up. The rest of the film is built around Rabbit finding his voice. On the surface it's a hip-hop Rocky, but while the subtext of Stallone's film was about putting a smart-talking black man - namely Muhammad Ali - in his place, 8 Mile is about defusing racial tension and focussing attention on the economic deprivation that intensifies division. As Future tells Rabbit: "When they hear you, it's not gonna matter what colour you are." \u000a																\u000a																If there's a fault with this set-up it's that the women are under-served. Rabbit's love interest Alex (Brittany Murphy - looking like Courtney Love circa 1991), is a wannabe model who is trying to make it by screwing someone to help her get a portfolio together. As for Basinger, her moment of redemption comes when she wins the bingo. For a film that skilfully negotiates racial and class-issues with a minimum of clichés, it's a little depressing that it is so reductive with its female characters.\u000a

VOkay then, so you haven't seen the original Inglorious Bastards. Worry no longer - Quentin Tarantino's latest has as much to do with Enzo G Castellari's exploitation movie as Ice-T has to do with the history of the East India Company. And those fretting that QT might still be on a Grind House kick can also calm themselves. Death Proof this ain't. His best film since Pulp Fiction it most certainly is. Not that everyone will see it as such. Indeed, you wouldn't have to try too hard to find Inglourious Basterds a trying exercise in excess and homage. Too in thrall to other movies and gratuitous violence the cynic might say. The trouble is, adopting this sort of position is to deny yourself a lot of entertainment. Because Inglourious Basterds is as much fun as you can have in a cinema without embarrassing an usher. It's 1943, and the war is in the balance. Jewish avengers, comedy Nazis (both Hitler and Goebbels are played for laughs), a veiled celebration of the cinema of Leni Riefenstahl - you'll find all human life in the Inglourious Basterds. Including a sadistic Standartenfuhrer known as "The Jew Hunter", played by the awesome Christoph Waltz . An Austrian actor resident in London, Tarantino has said he wouldn't have made Inglourious Basterds had he not discovered Waltz. Witty, slimy, vile, winning, subtle, overstated - his is the sort of complete performance upon which careers are founded. Put bluntly, he's the best thing about Inglourious Basterds, and the film is weaker every moment he's not on screen. You could say similar thing about Brad Pitt. Not that there's anything understated about his 'Aldo The Apache', leader of a Jewish-American platoon operating behind enemy lines. No, this is what you'd get if you brought together Clark Gable, Errol Flynn and John Wayne, and then stuck 'em in a blender. Hammy camera-hogging some might cry, but since that's the order of the day here, Pitt's efforts blend seamlessly with Mike Myers' seedy British General Ed Fenech, Diane Kruger's Dietrich-esque Bridget Von Hammersmark, and Eli Roth's muscle-bound, baseball bat-wielding Donny Donowitz.\u000aThere are almost too many highspots to point up. Take the opening sequence in which Waltz's Hans Lander interrogates a dairy farmer he believes guilty of harbouring Jews. Sure, the whole thing's a steal from The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, but the pacing, tension and dialogue are of a standard previously unseen in Tarantino's cinema. The ageing enfant terrible might not have grown up but he's certainly grown.

VIs everything falling apart or is it just us? It's been a traumatic start to the new century and then late in the decade comes a supposed Hollywood comic book blockbuster that asks: do we deserve to be saved from the terrorists? Or has democracy failed, and would we be safer under a fascist regime led by a man dressed as a bat?\u000a																\u000a																Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is an annihilating experience, especially if you watch it in the enormous IMAX theatre, a vertiginous phenomenon at the best of times; when that eight storey screen fills up with the scarred, sweating, greasepaint-smeared face of Heath Ledger's Joker, speaking of chaos and the cannibalism lurking under civilisation, the temptation is to run screaming into the night. The action is devastating, high-wire and realistic. The ideas are even more destructive, presenting Western civilisation as a precarious condition liable to break down when threatened with an enemy it cannot bargain with or buy off, an enemy who is insane and only wants to see it burn.\u000a																\u000a																That's hyperbole, sure. But hyperbole is the great stage upon which the modern mythology of comic book heroes plays out. The screenplay written by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, with additions to the story from David S Goyer, synthesizes crucial elements from two of the greatest Batman comics, Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns' and Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke'.\u000a																\u000a																From Miller's groundbreaking portrait of an ageing Batman, the screenplay inherits the malign influence of a masked vigilante upon society, and what demons are unleashed as an unintended consequence of the thrilling psychic and social disorder inspired by a Batman. From 'The Killing Joke' it extracts Moore's Joker, a connoisseur of insanity, visiting the same madness that led to his creation upon our heroes.\u000a																\u000a																The screenwriters have added a third provocation: when the Roman Empire had the barbarians at the gate, they suspended democracy and handed rule over to one man, Caesar, to protect them. Could Batman be the new Caesar? The Dark Knight puts us through the wringer on this one, toying with fascism as a way out of the endless fear and crime before showing, at its close, that even the best of men would be corrupted by the responsibility of being judge, jury and executioner.\u000a																Christopher Nolan's first pass at this material was Batman Begins in 2005, a dark and gloomy movie, no doubt, but it needed a dose of the Scarecrow's psychedelic poison to set the citizens of Gotham at one another's throats.\u000a																\u000a																This time, Heath Ledger's Joker drips fear and disorder into the body politic and the results are far more disturbing. Ledger tragically died after filming was completed, and the premature death of such a coruscating talent contributes a terrible urgency to his performance, rubbing away at your knowledge that the actor was just messing around. With his lank unwashed green hair, hunched shoulders and restless tongue, always drawing back the saliva from the scars at the corner of his smile, this Joker is all our fears of the amoral urban dispossessed (he likes his knife crime) multiplied by our terror of the suicide bomber, the killer who cannot be reasoned with, the murderer who wants nothing but our destruction. He is Kurt Cobain's self-hatred directed outwards, a nihilist to make Nietzsche quiver.\u000a																\u000a																Against the forces of darkness, we have a white knight. Aaron Eckhart's district attorney Harvey Dent, who wages effective war against the upper echelons of Gotham's criminal classes. Together with Gary Oldman's Lieutenant Gordon and Christian Bale's Batman, the forces of law and order gain the upper hand. Rachel Dawes, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, falls in love with Dent, an unexpected twist in affairs as Batman Begins had Rachel - then played by Katie Holmes - all set up to be the love of Bruce Wayne's life. Harvey and Batman's campaign is so effective that the criminals are forced to turn to the Joker, and so both men are responsible - if not entirely culpable - for the horrors that are unleashed, on the city and on themselves.\u000a																The Dark Knight succeeds where other comic book movies fail because of its bone-crunching physicality. On the IMAX screens, even the establishing shots of swooping city vistas are a white-knuckle ride.\u000a																\u000a																When the filmmakers flip a 40-foot tractor trailer in the heart of Chicago, you'll never want to see another computer-generated fight sequence again. That physicality also comes from the actors. Christian Bale thinned himself right down for The Machinist and was a raw-boned prisoner of war in Werner Herzog's Rescue Dawn; his martial arts work as Batman makes the close combat sing.\u000a																\u000a																Heath Ledger's Joker is like the wolf in 'Little Red Riding Hood', a mangy and disguised beast with a sardonic wit. He achieves more with one nurse's outfit than Jack Nicholson managed in the entirety of Tim Burton's Batman. It's only when the second villain of the piece appears, the horrific Two-Face, that we get a glimmer of computerised special effects - the result, by the way, is so bleak and scary that parents are advised against sneaking their little ones into this movie unless they want them to grow up disturbed.\u000a\u000a																The supporting cast add vital colour and context. Michael Caine's Alfred has the wisdom of a battle veteran, and his anecdotes from his time in Burma situate the comic book battle in the actual history of war. Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox once again plays Q to Batman's Bond, and provides an ethical check to the hero's flirtation with Big-Brother-style fascism. Gary Oldman's Lieutenant Gordon is the pragmatic face of the good cop who teeters on the edge when his family is threatened.\u000a																\u000a																The coup de grace of The Dark Knight is its structure. An ending seems to come, and emotionally you are drained but prepared for a third film that will complete the trilogy. That third film then unfolds before you. Here the gates of hell open up with the appearance of Two-Face and the further ramifications of the Joker's plan.\u000a																\u000a																Too often superhero films climax with a dull slugfest between computer-generated heroes and villains: here the ending reminds one of Fight Club's tower block-set face-off with something of Sophie's Choice and Michael Mann's Manhunter ; an emotionally draining encounter that ensures the film does not disappear into a flurry of special effects.\u000a

V\u000aIn Christopher Nolan's 2008 comic-book crime epic The Dark Knight, stalwart police lieutenant James Gordon called Batman, the caped crusader, 'the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.' When it comes to Nolan's brand of super-sized cinema, though, you could say the opposite is true. Nolan's focus on spectacle, celluloid and smart narrative concepts is a very necessary ally in the ongoing battle to keep film relevant as a mass-market entertainment. Then again, no one deserves to sit through almost three hours of rear-numbing cinema unless there's good reason to.\u000aAt just shy of 170 minutes, Interstellar is Nolan's longest film to date, but it's also by turns his most brazenly ambitious and mind-numbingly ponderous. Matthew McConaughey caps off his 'McConaissance' arc from smarmy romcom lead to indie darling to Oscar winner by leading this, the most ambitious blockbuster of the year, and lending it some required rootsy charm in the process. His southern-fried smoothness is a good fit for Cooper, a once-promising pilot reduced to being a farmer and single dad in Nolan's near-future America, which has turned agrarian after successive Dust Bowl-like catastrophes ravage the world's crops.\u000aIt's a compelling start, and the solution, like in many sci-fi stories before it, lies in the stars. 'Solution' is the key term here, as Interstellar reveals that, while Christopher Nolan may court comparisons to the likes of cosmic auteurs Stanley Kubrick (2001) and Terrence Malick (The Tree Of Life), his big scientific and philosophical questions are rarely left unanswered, even when they touch on themes better left just out of comprehension's reach. The effect is not unlike Inception, which resembled a film about dreams made by someone who had never dreamt: this is a sci-fi film that rejects the mysteries of the galaxy for the comfort of resolution.\u000aWhat Interstellar does have is scale in all dimensions, and the worlds envisaged by Nolan, his VFX crew at Double Negative and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (better known for more intimate fare, such as Her, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Let The Right One In) are as technically accomplished as we've come to expect. Likewise, Nolan's pulling power with A-grade actors is undiminished, with Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and a few unbilled surprises willing to strap in for the ride - even if, in Caine and Hathaway's cases, they are primarily engines for elongated scenes of exposition.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000aNever has a nearly-three-hour blockbuster enthralled me in the way that Interstellar did. After the grim seriousness and plodding pacing of his Dark Knight films, where Christopher Nolan did his damnedest to provide a real world for an utterly ridiculous character to play in, it\u2019s a relief to see him freed from such constraints.\u000aNot that there isn\u2019t solid science underpinning Interstellar\u2019s world-building (and departing), in fact there\u2019s a ton of it. Those not interested in cosmological hows and whys may find the necessary infodumps all too frequent, but where Interstellar eclipses Nolan\u2019s creativity as seen onscreen previously is in the sense of awe, wonder and spectacle he\u2019s able to conjure on this trip into the unknown.\u000aThat the film veers all over the place is, to me, one of the things that justifies its length. Giving himself more of that precious resource, time, to play with (and jettisoning the expected training montage second act), Nolan gets to introduce A-list actors late, indulge in sub-plots that don\u2019t emerge until the final half hour, and take us to some truly spectacular places along the way.\u000aThe cast are good, if not outright great. As with other Nolan pics, his ability to construct strong characters powered by real emotion is lacking. Luckily the likes of McConaughey, Chastain, Caine and even Hathaway (mostly) bring plenty to their performances.\u000aPerhaps this is all sounding ho hum to you. But if space travel, sci-fi and visual spectacle appeal, you can\u2019t look past this triumph of the imagination where the wondrous universe is the true star. Interstellar renders this semi-palatable for mainstream consumption thanks to co-writers Jonathan Nolan and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. Add a director who may not have the singularity of vision possessed by Kubrick (himself flawed), and you\u2019ve still got one of the most watchable self-indulgent projects in ages.\u000a\u2018Interstellar\u2019 movie times\u000a\u000a

But, the science fiction adventure film has problems after take-off. \u201cInterstellar\u201d is a flawed but fascinating journey featuring plot elements that seem more Spielbergian than Nolanesque. And, an outrageously unbalanced sound design becomes a major distraction late in the film. More on that, later.\u000aA memorable sci-fi has to be more than just special effects. The story needs to equal all the razzle-dazzle. \u201cInterstellar\u201d feels like someone else\u2019s film, a Spielberg retread.\u000aThe story opens with a widower (Matthew McConaughey) trying to keep his family unit functioning while the world literally crumbles into dust clouds. Earth needs food to feed its seven billion residents. And, that means family farms are of the utmost importance. Former engineer/astronaut Cooper (McConaughey) lives in a low-tech world that doesn\u2019t need space travel anymore. Technology is on the fritz. So, Cooper manages the family farm with his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and his two children, Murph and Tom.\u000aAfter a strange gravitational event in his daughter\u2019s bedroom, Cooper and Murph (Mackenzie Foy) hit the road to find a secret NASA operation planning an intergalactic mission. It\u2019s no surprise that Steven Spielberg was interested in this project, since it reportedly was written for him. And, the first 45 minutes is basically \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d minus the giant mound of mashed potatoes. Co-screenwriter Jonathan Nolan (Christopher\u2019s brother) likely added the family/unearthly message elements as a way to attract and/or appease Spielberg.\u000aSo, when Christopher Nolan took over as director, the Spielberg elements needed to go. It\u2019s not his movie anymore. Nolan would be better served with a complete rewrite.\u000aWhen Cooper agrees to pilot a spaceship through a wormhole in a frantic effort to find a new habitable planet, that\u2019s when the story gets interesting. At the secret NASA operation, he meets his old professor (Michael Caine), the man with most of the answers. The crew of the Endurance includes the professor\u2019s daughter, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway).\u000aRest of the story I will leave to you. Because, despite my complaints, I don\u2019t want to keep you from seeing this film or ruin the discovery process. Keep in mind, Nolan\u2019s worst film is better than most of the crap coming out of Hollywood these days.\u000aNolan used IMAX cameras for much of this production, and it shows. The photography is spectacular. The special effects are awesome.\u000aSo, what happened with Zimmer\u2019s score? It was overpowering in key scenes. I couldn\u2019t understand the dialogue.  You could hear the characters speaking, but you could NOT comprehend what they were saying.  Nolan says he planned it that way. Hard to believe, unless he\u2019s gone nuts.\u000aThe acting in this space saga is quite excellent. Especially, McConaughey. He is the perfect everyman to go on this adventure.  Any praise he gets for this film is well-deserved.\u000aFinally, the running time is 169 minutes. That\u2019s over three hours, folks. The story would have been better served with more specifics on why the earth was becoming uninhabitable.\u000aThe takeaway from \u201cInterstellar\u201d is that Christopher Nolan is human after all.  It\u2019s a trip marred by sound distortion, but still worthwhile.

VRent this film now on Film4oD\u000aKubrick, cinema's chilliest genius, abandons conventional narrative here and presents a succession of beautifully-composed sketches on the theme of evolution, death and rebirth linked by the mystical presence of a large black monolith. A fight between a group of proto-human apes demonstrates man's first use of tools, as one seizes a bone and adopts it as a weapon after experiencing some sort of epiphany by contact with the black slab. A brilliant jump cut from the bone hurled into the air to a spacecraft floating in space fast forwards the film to the year 2001. Strange happenings on the moon, involving the discovery of another - or the same - black slab and mysterious signals emanating from Jupiter lead to an exploratory mission to the giant planet on the 'Discovery'. On board, astronauts Dr Frank Poole (Lockwood) and Dr Dave Bowman (Dullea) carry out their duties precisely, monotonously, until the ship's omniscient computer HAL 2000 (voiced with sinister creaminess by Rain) malfunctions and events spiral out of control.After an impressionistic, nay psychedelic, trans-dimensional voyage, Poole encounters his own dying moments, and the film concludes with the birth of a 'star child'.This central film in Kubrick's informal science-fiction trilogy (started with Dr Strangelove and concluded with A Clockwork Orange) is a beautiful, wilful parable. Epic in its vision, immaculate - and yet to be bettered in its conception - and ambiguously philosophical in its musings, 2001 deserves the title masterpiece.

VIn the hands of many another director, Notorious would have been merely a film noir - a cruel story of a courageous, patriotic young woman turned inside out by manipulative and unscrupulous men, one of whom uses her love for him to force her into extreme danger. But with Hitchcock it becomes something deeper: a glorious exercise in film style, where virtuoso camerawork combines with the characters to create a wonderful harmony of visuals and narrative - and where the complexities of character and story exist above and beyond the dictates of genre.\u000a																\u000a																Alicia Huberman (Bergman, in perhaps her best performance), is the daughter of a Nazi scientist who is recruited by the FBI in the person of T.R.Devlin (Grant, mixing manipulation and malign intent into his usual unruffled, suave screen persona) to infiltrate a group of Nazis in Rio De Janeiro - the Macguffin here is radioactive material secreted in wine bottles.\u000a																\u000a																Despite being in love with Devlin, Huberman marries the Nazi cell's leader, Sebastian (Rains) in order to infiltrate the group totally - and paradoxically Sebastian's genuine love for this lonely, alcoholic, insecure woman makes him more appealing than the cynical and aptly named Devlin, who really has no compunction about exploiting her love to his own ends. It's a recipe for danger, disaster and death that comes magnificently to the boil in the story's final moments.\u000a																The story is tightly woven, and brilliantly sustained - and interesting for the risks it takes with its characters. The hero and heroine are flawed: one cruel and manipulative, the other an alcholic flirt, while the bad guy has moral and heroic qualities that should be unseemly in an ex Nazi. And the camerawork is often stunning. In one shot, a hungover Alicia sees Devlin upside down, and the camera pulls back to show him sliding across the floor towards her: Apart from being a virtuosic move, this conveys more about Devlin's slithery, untrustworthy character than mere words could ever manage. Hitchcock, it hardly needs saying, certainly knew how to use this visual medium to full and satisfying effect.

V"Why can't you come?" asks young Mourad (Youssef Tiberkanine) when his new, equally young neighbour Cyril (Thomas Doret) rejects an invitation to the cinema. "It's in 3D. It'll be fun!"\u000aCyril's refusal to go along represents a wittily oblique encapsulation of the filmmaking aesthetic that drives the Dardenne brothers. For their films, too, eschew the eye-popping sensationalism of Hollywood blockbusters, preferring the sort of rigorous naturalism and demi-monde environs more usually associated with the oeuvre of Robert Bresson (Pickpocket, Mouchette, L'Argent).\u000aCyril does not want to go to the local flicks because he has an appointment with Wes (Egon Di Mateo), a manipulative hoodlum exploiting the boy's need for a father figure. Abandoned by his own dad Guy (Jeremie Renier, also a feckless father in the Dardennes' The Child) to a state-run children's home, Cyril clings tenaciously to the unrealistic prospect of Guy coming back for him. Indeed, when we first meet Cyril (nicknamed 'Pitbull' by Wes for his tenacity), he refuses to return a telephone to one of his carers, desperately clutching the receiver as though it were a lifeline to his father (who is absent even from telecommunications). Later, when Cyril runs away to look for his father in what was once their apartment, the boy tries to evade his carers by clinging desperately to a compete stranger. "Not so tight, it hurts," protests Samantha (Cecile de France) - but moved by the boy's (and perhaps her own) intense neediness, the hairdresser locates Cyril's beloved bike for him, and agrees to foster him on weekends.\u000a"I'm not dreaming," Cyril insists to Samantha - yet it is precisely the boy's gradual, painful disillusionment that The Kid With A Bike traces, as Cyril comes to grips with the unwelcome truth about his father's disinterest, learns to accept someone else's unconditional love, and starts to take responsibility for his own actions. With the Dardennes' regular DP Alain Marcoen following Cyril's rites of passage in unobtrusive tracking shots, the film never soft-pedals the treacherous byways and alternative routes that Cyril only narrowly avoids on his road to security and happiness. Here institutionalisation, criminality, even death itself, are no more than a stone's throw away  and, in a suitably cyclical depiction of morality, what goes around comes around.\u000aMeanwhile, some expertly-handled moments of heightened tension - and Doret's spirited, forceful debut  obviate any need for additional 3D.    \u000a

VClint Eastwood and the western waited years for Oscar recognition, but this grave movie did the trick - possibly because it is so determinedly serious as well as being wonderfully well-made.  From its comic presentation of an aging gunfighter turned farmer trying to swill pigs, we are presented with a nuanced characterisation that is the heart of the film. Failing to find peace, but sickened by violence, Bill Munny (Eastwood whose craggy features have also never seemed more suited to a role) is enticed back into the saddle with the enticement of bounty (a cowboy has viciously scarred a prostitute and her fellow workers club together for revenge) and the chance to secure a future for his children.  The film becomes an odyssey of pain and retribution, but, significantly, within it's sombre narrative it charts the progress of a lost human being heading towards a kind of salvation.  It's superbly crafted, with taut, muscular direction from Eastwood and intense, disturbing cinematography from Jack Green. The performances from the distinguished cast are nothing short of blistering.

VPaths Of Glory was the first time Stanley Kubrick got to work with a major star - and in the late 1950s, stars didn't come any more major than Kirk Douglas. He championed this 'hard to sell' anti-war film to the Hollywood studios, and bankrolled the 28-year-old tyro director who, with his growing reputation, still had it all to prove in Hollywood. And with his indignant performance Douglas provides an emotional counterbalance to Kubrick's chilly, conceptual style. \u000a																\u000a																Adapted from Humphrey Cobb's based-on-fact novel, the film tells the ignominious, bitterly ironic, even absurd, WWI story of a botched French attack, which is motivated purely by the gains it will bring to high-up officers safely ensconced far from the front. In return for a promised promotion, General Mireau (Macready), charges his troops with the impossible task of storming Ant Hill, an impregnable German position. The attack is led by Colonel Dax (Douglas), who before the war was "the finest criminal lawyer in France" and who dutifully leads his men into the German guns, knowing that a slaughter is inevitable. When the attack dissolves into chaos and a rout, the furious general first orders his artillery to fire on his own men, and, to pass the blame, chooses three soldiers at random to go before a court martial to explain their cowardice, with Dax acting as defence counsel in the face their inevitable execution. \u000a																This dark, misanthropic subject matter is typical Kubrick, and it drips with a savage, bleak understanding of man's inhumanity to man. The officers (Dax excepted) are scheming self-aggrandisers whose interest in strategy relates principally to the progress of their careers. In fact, Kubrick has formulated a double-bind as absurd and horrific as that of Catch-22: the French military command is structured so that it's more or less impossible even for conscientious officers to champion the cause of their men, who are basically pure cannon-fodder. \u000a																 \u000a																Kubrick's telling of this story is highly lucid, even schematic. The officers in their chateaux are shot with elegant, fluid dolly shots and deep focus that Kubrick learned from Max Ophuls and Orson Welles, while the men in the trenches are treated with an almost documentary realism that emphasises the hell they are living through. The film is memorable for its extended, virtuoso tracking shots through the trenches (they anticipate the crazed Steadicam of The Shining) and for the unprecedented realism of its battle scenes, with Kubrick using 800 German policemen for his troops (the film was shot in southern Germany) and with his art department having to go before the German government to explain why they needed so much explosive. \u000a																But aside from its brilliant battle scenes and unrivalled attention to detail, the film plays out like a game of chess, a cold-hearted working out of a pitiless strategy, where the infantry soldiers really are nothing more than pawns. Dax, condemned by his superiors as an "idealist" when he shows ordinary human consideration for his men, finally turns the machinations of Mireau against him after the terrible injustice of the men's execution. Kubrick's geometrical, symmetrical compositions (he was also camera operator on the movie) are designed to make his characters seem like chessmen on a board - which is an apt visual metaphor for the callous and calculating behaviour of the officers in the story. Not surprisingly, the film was banned in France for 18 years after its release.

It is, however, a slick, satisfying and deeply influential movie which keeps its chase-plot going with furious momentum.\u000aThe action involves Arnie's robotic killing machine from The Terminator returning to the present, but this time as guardian angel protecting little John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the murderous attention of a shape-shifting machine (Robert Patrick, sporting a wonderfully impassive expression throughout) from the future. Arnie's T-101 unit has been reprogrammed by the human resistance - by John himself in fact, who 35 years later is the leader. The shape-shifting T-1000, on the other hand, represents the computer enemy; he's out to destroy the boy and change the course of history.\u000aThere are other things to hold the interest: Cameron's suggestion, for instance, that Arnie's leather-clad android would make a suitable father-figure for Furlong and an appropriate partner for his mother (Hamilton, muscular, sweaty, and single-minded). That's the chilling idea under the pyrotechnics, incessant machine-gun fire and innovative special effects (the morphing T-1000 was a landmark of digital animation) - if there is a future in which the robots go to war with humanity, it won't really matter much who wins.

p463

V"He was some kind of a man... What does it matter what you say about people?" It could be Welles' epitaph as much as that of Hank Quinlan, the obese, vile and potentially corrupt US border cop. If Welles is to be remembered for something other than Citizen Kane, it would probably be the justly famous opening tracking shot here, the ideal introduction to a perfectly stylized noir. \u000a																\u000aTouch of Evil had a chequered history. The original script by Paul Monash was shelved by B-movie producer Albert Zugsmith. Welles was employed to act in it, then encouraged to direct too. He didn't bother to read the source novel ('Badge Of Evil' by Whit Masterson). After the best part of a decade working in TV or on international features (1955's Mr. Arkadin was a French/Spanish/Swiss production), Welles returned to Hollywood and created another masterpiece. \u000a																\u000a																But it's amazing the film survived at all - Welles was sacked in post-production and it very nearly never saw the light of day. Instead, the studio hacked it into a supporting movie, a B-movie. Restored as per his original notes in the 1990s, Touch Of Evil has emerged near faultless in style and characterisation; a confirmed masterpiece and one of the great American classics. The film concerns Mexican narcotics officer Mike Vargas (Heston, in a role that twisted his usual all-American heroic credentials) who is on honeymoon with young American wife Susan (Leigh) in a fictional border town (Los Robles, which was recreated in rundown Venice, California). Vargas gets caught up with political intrigue involving, among others, a sharp-tongued hooker (Dietrich, brilliant) and corrupt local cop Quinlan (Welles, brilliantly vile).

VWeighing in with a heavyweight work that tops anything he has done since 1992's Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood's boxing saga Million Dollar Baby is a relentlessly unsentimental melodrama that delivers its body-blows when you least expect them. After the somewhat hysterical Mystic River - a flawed work dominated by a powerhouse performance from Sean Penn - this is a far more balanced piece, anchored by three terrific turns and some lean direction from Eastwood.\u000a																\u000a																To give away the secrets of the plot would be criminal. Suffice it to say it's a story about redemption that embraces religion, family and social affairs. Eastwood plays grizzled boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, owner of The Hit Pit gym in downtown Los Angeles. Laced with guilt, when he's not at the gym he's either attending mass (as he has done for 23 years) or writing letters to his estranged daughter, all of which come back marked 'return to sender'. If that wasn't enough, he also blames himself for the loss of an eye sustained in the ring by ex-boxer Scrap (Freeman), who Frankie used to train and who now looks after the day-to-day running of the gym.Narrated by Scrap - with Freeman's trademark soothing voice adding resonance to every line - the story sees Frankie reluctant to take his boxers the distance and get them shots at title fights. When his prize asset, Big Willie Little (Colter), dumps him for new management, Frankie is left with little option but to take on a newcomer who has been hanging around the gym. Trouble is, she's a girl - and he doesn't train girls. A white trash waitress with a brother in prison, a sister on welfare and a mother who weighs 312lbs, Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) may have been brought up on the wrong side of the tracks, but slowly she wears Frankie down until he takes her on. But, at 32, has she got what it takes to fight professionally?\u000a																\u000a																If it sounds like a mix of Girlfight and Rocky, nothing could be further from the truth. Eastwood dances around the dreaded clichés of punch-drunk sagas with impressive footwork. Adapted by Paul Haggis from 'Rope Burns', a collection of short stories by FX Toole, the script has a sardonic wit about it, with Scrap in particular adding some much-needed humour. "The planet can go back to spinning," he dryly notes, after Frankie, in a rare act of kindness, buys him a cheeseburger. There is also a nicely judged sub-plot featuring a weak-kneed wannabe named 'Danger' (Baruchel), desperate to challenge Thomas Hearns for the welterweight title, not knowing he retired years ago. \u000a																\u000a																With Swank proving that her Oscar for Boys Don't Cry was not a one-off, she is both physically and emotionally credible in her role. For once, in the training montage - a boxing movie staple - it actually appears as if her physique is becoming more toned and muscular, proving she really did shed blood, sweat and tears for the part. As for Eastwood, here offering his best performance since The Bridges Of Madison County (1995), it's delightful to see that he has once again found it in him to be able to direct himself. While Frankie Dunn is a part less overtly iconic than 'Dirty' Harry Callaghan, Eastwood's turn is finely-judged and completely lacking in vanity - rather like the film itself.

Director Mike Leigh and actor Timothy Spall have painted their own masterpiece.\u000aTurner\u2019s genius was established early in his career, and Leigh chose to focus on the latter half of the artist\u2019s life when he became even better known and more eccentric. Turner\u2019s devotion to his ailing father is clear in the film. As were the relationships with women that kept him unmarried, by choice, his entire life. Leigh\u2019s screenplay also captures Turner\u2019s artistic independence, both his stubbornness and epic vision.\u000aGreat accolades can be heaped on Spall\u2019s interpretation of Turner. Did the artist grunt, groan and speak in spurts? I don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care. Spall dives deep and fascinates with his performance. It took me several minutes to adjust to his dialect, but I eventually heard every word spoken by this worthy actor.\u000aMost of the ensemble cast checks out as well. Dorothy Atkinson generates sympathy as Hannah Danby, Turner\u2019s devoted housekeeper. Marion Bailey does an admirable job as Sophia Booth, Turner\u2019s landlady and eventual lover. She made Turner\u2019s seaside home a peaceful, desirable retreat. Paul Jesson excelled as Turner\u2019s father. He and Spall played well off each other. The mutual love and devotion between these two characters was realized.\u000aThe costumes, the sets, the cinematography transport you magnificently to Turner\u2019s era.

V\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sun is God,\u201d were the last words uttered by Joseph Mallord William Turner on Dec. 19, 1851. Now proclaimed as Britain\u2019s greatest artist, his talent is the soul of Mike Leigh\u2018s new film, Mr. Turner. Coming after his other historical dramas\u2014the effervescent Topsy-Turvy, about Gilbert and Sullivan, and the dreary, bleak Vera Drake, which focuses on an abortionist in the 1950s\u2014this is perhaps his most spare, yet illuminating film to date. He\u2019s certainly picked a perfect subject: Turner was a bona fide genius who never stopped experimenting or challenging convention, yet, as Leigh shows, his personal life was a mess, including unhappy illegitimate children and a rather odd housekeeper who provided à la carte services for her boss.\u000aThough Leigh\u2019s film follows a basic chronological approach, starting when the artist is at the height of his fame, it is arranged as a series of vignettes rather than a completely fleshed out, plot-driven movie. And for someone as complex as J.M.W. Turner, that is perhaps the best way to capture the dichotomy of the man. Coddled by his father, who runs his household, sells his paintings and even mixes the valuable pigments and colours used to create those spectacular works of art, Turner is a crude, driven man comfortable in his selfishness. His world revolves around his ability to translate three-dimensional vistas into two-dimensional paintings. He thinks nothing of dropping everything, and everyone, for a painting excursion.\u000aIt\u2019s actor Timothy Spall who brings what could have been a two-dimensional caricature to life. Spall immersed himself in the Dickensian world of Victorian London, even spending two years learning to paint. His every twitch, lumpen step and grunt\u2014dialogue is at an absolute minimum\u2014conveys more than the wordiest of scripts. After winning at Cannes, Spall is all but guaranteed to get an Oscar nomination.\u000aRelated reading: Brian D. Johnson\u2019s best films of 2014\u000aThe other force behind Mr. Turner who should earn an Oscar nod is Dick Pope, the movie\u2019s cinematographer, who turned film into a work that would rival any Turner painting. From the very first scene in the Dutch countryside, to the last of the dying artist, the lush visuals\u2014especially its raw landscapes and delicately gorgeous sunrises and sunsets\u2014celebrate the artist.\u000aTurner lived in a time of deprivation and enormous wealth, an era when constant work and graft was the only way the son of a barber could rise to be one of the art world\u2019s greats. Yet, for all his achievements and financial security, the unpolished, slovenly genius constantly chafed against convention. The scenes of Turner sizing up his competition, including John Constable, at the Royal Academy, are deliciously subversive.\u000aIronically, as his works become less recognizable and more and more evocative\u2014Rain, Steam and Speed: The Great Western Railway breathes the disruptive fury and power of the new-fangled trains\u2014his personal life became more pedestrian, even happy. He settled down with a widow, Sophia Booth, who fussed over Turner with the same un-awed affection of his father. Even after his death, Turner was anything but normal: He gave most of his fortune away, and donated his collection of his own, best works to the nation. Even today, his namesakes\u2014the Turner Prize, for example\u2014conjures up images of innovation and experimentation.\u000aAs the Guardian stated, \u201cIf the sun is God, as Turner is supposed to have said, this incandescent painter was the sun\u2019s high priest and art is indebted to him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a10 shares\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse filmJ.M.W.

He has a loving wife (Laura Linney), and a loyal best buddy (the excellent Noah Emmerich). Life is good until one morning a stage light drops from the skies and shatters on the ground perilously close to him. It is the trigger that sets him questioning everything around him. What is behind the facades of the buildings he has never entered? Why do people seem to be travelling around him in a perfectly synchronized loop? What is going on outside his home-town? Truman is, it turns out, the unwitting star of a top-rated 24-hour-a-day TV docu-soap.  Under the careful critical scrutiny to which it has been subjected, the plot turns out not to be watertight. This is to miss the point of what is a hilarious and breathtakingly conceived satire which also allows Carrey to edge away from broad comedy.  The Truman Show is also oddly moving and has, as you would expect from a Weir film, a pronounced metaphysical slant with Ed Harris playing the show's archly named producer/creator Christof.

V\u000a\u000a\u000aPrisoners is a pulpy crime thriller elevated to event film status by top-notch filmmakers. It outstays its welcome by a good half hour but still proves compelling, thanks in part to subject matter that practically demands emotional investment from an audience: children in peril.\u000aA lot of attention will go to Jackman\u2019s turn as a survivalist dad driven to extremes to find his abducted daughter, and to his credit he gives it his all. But it\u2019s Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance as Detective Loki that feels the most lived in (although he does overdo it with a certain nervous twitch), and it\u2019s with him that our sympathies ultimately lie.\u000aThe central mystery that drives the movie ends up being a bit silly, stitched together from similar films that suggest every small American town houses at least one raving loony. A few of the more left-field plot turns remain puzzling once all has been revealed. But director Denis Villeneuve keeps the focus on the aftermath of the abductions, wallowing in the panic and grief and giving Jackman a chance to flex his acting muscles.\u000aWith subject matter this dreary, Prisoners can be a bit of a slog at times. Villeneuve has a point to make about people being capable of terrible things when pushed to extremes, and he makes it very bluntly, only to drop this line of thought once it\u2019s time for the big finale. Prisoners can\u2019t seem to decide what sort of film it wants to be, and so it ends up slightly muddled, engrossing enough in the moment but frustratingly insubstantial on reflection.\u000a\u2018Prisoners\u2019 Movie Times\u000a\u000a

V\u000aIt's no surprise that Aaron Guzikowski's original screenplay for Prisoners languished on The Black List, a register of inexplicably unfilmed scripts, for some time. It features elements seldom found in formulaic Hollywood studio projects: complicated characters, ambiguous motives and serious moral dilemmas. It's less of a surprise that French-Canadian film-maker Denis Villeneuve, whose award-winning 2010 film Incendies possessed all these qualities in spades, chose this script for his first English-language feature. Or that having done so, he was able to attract a heavyweight cast of actors - Hugh Jackman. Jake Gyllenhaal, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo - to play both the leading parts and the more modest supporting roles. \u000aPrior to the disappearance of his six-year-old daughter and her seven-year-old friend, Keller Dover (Jackman) was a hard-working blue collar guy who prayed for the best but prepared for the worst. A survivalist whose basement was stuffed with tinned food and emergency equipment, Dover lived by his father's maxim: be ready. But nothing had prepared him for a parent's worst nightmare. His wife Grace (Bello), numbed by grief and anti-depressants, berates him for not protecting his family. But Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is forced to release the chief suspect (Dano), a man in his twenties with the mind of a child, after only forty-eight hours. Knowing that his daughter's chances of survival are reducing with every passing hour, Dover abducts and tortures Alex, with the reluctant help of the other girl's father (Howard) and his passively complicit wife (Davis). Encouraging the audience to identify with the father's dilemma, Villeneuve's film poses the ethical question, How far would you go, and what might you be capable of?\u000aPersistent rain and Roger Deakins' extraordinary, near-monochromatic cinematography establish a murky atmosphere, creating a sense of characters enveloped by a miasma of impotent rage, primal fear and nagging doubt. Villeneuve's emotionally charged direction draws the best from the actors, including the ever credible Melissa Leo as the suspect's over-protective aunt \u2013 a woman scarred by the disappearance of her husband and the earlier loss of her own son to cancer. Even so, Jackman overplays his portrayal of the ruthlessly pragmatic Dover; this contrasts starkly with Gyllenhaal's laser-focused portrayal of the meticulous Detective Loki, which reveals layer upon layer of subtle complexity. Sadly, there are echoes here of Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, whose dense plotting and thought-provoking seriousness were ultimately undermined by a reliance on residual generic trappings and audience gullibility \u2013 as exemplified here by a transparently ludicrous red herring and a credibility-stretching plot twist.\u000a

VWith the dialogue-free first act of WALL-E, Pixar challenged the assumptions underlying family animated movies. The little robot's courtship of EVE had the physical aplomb of a silent movie, each character constructed out of the minimum of elements required to make us love them. The achievement was recognised with an Oscar for Best Animation. With Up, Pixar and Disney continue their adventure in pared-back storytelling, repudiating the pernicious received wisdom that what children require from a film is the discharge from a blunderbuss of pop culture gags, demographically-engineered characters, infantile wisecracks and celebrity voices.\u000a																\u000a																Excess is a sign of anxiety, of uncertainty about what works. The mission to strip out superfluity begins with the opening short film, Partly Cloudy. Where do babies come from? A stork delivers them in a bundle. Every child knows that. Walt Disney used this parental euphemism for the opening of Dumbo. Here the Pixar-Disney team build around the premise, with clouds creating life and then handing it over to the weary storks to deliver. Not a word is spoken. These shorts are proving grounds for the studio's upcoming talent: the remit is to return feature film animation to its roots, as a universal form of storytelling, reclaiming it from the sassy motormouth of the Shrek era.\u000a																\u000a																Up begins with a downer. A quiet boy called Carl is befriended by tomboy Ellie. "You don't say much," she notices, tellingly. Carl and Ellie are in thrall to the daring explorer Charles Muntz, whose adventures in the lost isle of Paradise Falls are captured in black-and-white Movietone reels. Carl and Ellie pledge to go on adventures of their own. But love gets in the way. They get married. They do up their house and decorate the nursery. Then in one heartbreaking moment, we realise they can't have children. The film is presented in 3-D, which requires the audience to wear special glasses. They don't work very well when your eyes are full of tears. Carl and Ellie grow old together, and then she dies.\u000a																\u000a																Carl is left alone in their house, surrounded by a building site. A developer wants him to move. He refuses but then his anger gets the better of him. On the day they show up to take Carl away, he unfurls thousands of balloons, and he and his house float up, up and away. But he has a stowaway. A tubby boy scout called Russell. The adventure of this odd couple begins.\u000a																Childlessness, the death of grandparents, and the crankiness of adults - all part of children's everyday lives. Carl is a bold choice for the hero of a kid's film, but children are fascinated by what it might be like to grow old. Hayao Miyazaki explored this fascination in Howl's Moving Castle, in which the young heroine is transformed into an old woman and has to come to terms with aches and pains. Roald Dahl knew a lot about the appeal of a quirky Grandpa Joe.\u000a																\u000a																When they land in the wilderness, Carl and Russell have to drag the floating house behind them. A house is the repository of our dreams. That is why we are so susceptible to property booms, to the fantasy of the house carrying us to paradise. Tethered to floating house he can no longer enter, Carl is bound to his unrealised dream, a negative equity of the soul.\u000a																\u000a																At Paradise Falls, they encounter the ageing explorer Charles Muntz who is pursuing his own Moby Dick, a rare and splendid bird that Russell has befriended and christened Kevin. While the adults blindly chase after what is always out of reach, it is up to Russell and a faithful talking dog to provide necessary moral direction.\u000a																Dug the talking dog demonstrates the Pixar-Disney style under the oversight of John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton. One of the highpoints of Disney's Bolt - executive produced by Lasseter - was the talking pigeons. The humour came from the animators giving voice to the birds' avian twitches and movements. Dug's dialogue is plausibly canine, and all the funnier for it.\u000a																\u000a																Pixar came back to Disney after the House of Mouse's farrago with Chicken Little, where they came unstuck pouring the brattish complexities of contemporary American youth into oversized chicken heads. Chicken Little stands as the nadir of confused groupthink filmmaking, and a low-point in anthropomorphism. The creative leadership of the Pixar team restores clarity, simplicity, and courage to storytelling, establishing a daunting gold standard for family films.

V\u000aIn the five years since the events of How To Train Your Dragon  (2010), the island village of Berk has become a peaceful haven where  Vikings and dragons live in harmony, bothering nobody but the sheep that  they use as balls in Quidditch-like competitions.\u000aYoung Hiccup (voiced again by Jay Baruchel) has won over the whole  community to his once rebellious dragon-loving ways, but remains  reluctant to replace his very different father Stoick (Gerard Butler) as  village chief, preferring to quest ever further afield in search of  more dragons - and the origins of his own nature. These he finds  simultaneously on a secret island whose sole human inhabitant is the  mysterious dragon-rider Valka (Cate Blanchett) - but Hiccup's travels  will also lead him to Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou), a would-be tyrant  over dragons and humans alike.\u000aWhile this sequel, again adapted loosely from the books of Cressida  Cowell, is still full of laughs, Hiccup himself is now an earnest emo  unsure of his own identity,   leaving most of the comic business to his  menagerie of friends and fellow villagers. This is a far more serious  film than its predecessor, even if writer/director Dean DeBlois  judiciously cuts away from some of the more adult moments in the film's  second half.\u000aThe key theme here, at work in both human and dragon worlds, is the  complex (and gratifyingly unresolved) interplay between nature and  nurture, between genetic legacy and free will, between instinct and  choice. Some - but certainly not all - characters exhibit a capacity for  profound change, while nobody, but nobody, questions the 'other reason'  that Gobber (Craig Ferguson) has never married. Tolerance,  mutual understanding and respect are the ideals that this film  champions, emblematised in the relationship between Hiccup and his  dragon Toothless - but How To Train Your Dragon 2 also demonstrates how  easily despots can manipulate and crush such values, bringing Hiccup's  brand of liberal-minded reasoning into violent collision with its own  limits. These are big issues indeed, as fitting for the post-millennial  as the Viking age - but for those uninterested in such matters, there  are also spit jokes and flights of fancy aplenty...\u000a\u000a

VDenis Villeneuve's film opens with a striking prologue: a vision of a rich yet dry, mountainous landscape, which recedes to reveal a contrastingly bleak, though no less absorbing, tableau, of a spartan, stone-walled shell of a building overlooking the idyllic countryside. Inside it, a group of young boys, simply dressed, are having their heads shaved in what appears to be an initiatory rite. The camera finally alights on one innocent-looking child with a particularly intense gaze, then homes in on the three seemingly innocuous dots he has tattooed on his heel (which will later take on vital significance to the film's plot). Breathtakingly photographed by Andre Turpin, its slow-mo, dreamlike quality is enhanced by the distant strains of Radiohead's 'You And Whose Army?' which provides the soundtrack, and it's one of the most arresting opening sequences of a film I can remember seeing in years.\u000aIt sets the bar improbably high for the rest of the film, a weighty, intricate inter-generational saga which unsurpirisingly struggles to extend the impressionistic power (though not the intensity) of its opening across its two hour-plus running time.  Set in an anonymous Middle Eastern country which resembles Lebanon in all but name, Canadian director Villeneuve's impressive drama, adapted from a play by Lebanese writer Wajdi Mouawad, strives to make emotional sense of decades of civil war through the prism of one family's complex emotional (and literal) DNA. \u000aWhen Nawal (Lubna Azabal), an expatriate living in Canada and mother to adult twins Jeanne and Simon, dies suddenly, she leaves the pair two sealed envelopes and an instruction that they be delivered to their father (who they had previously been led to believe was dead) and an older brother who they never knew existed. This quest takes Jeanne and Simon far from their drizzly Quebec neighbourhood to their mother's childhood home in the Middle East, where Nawal's painful personal narrative and professional recruitment by the Muslim paramilitary is sketched by lengthy flashback sequences, as well as the twins' own detective work.\u000aThrough Nawal's experiences, the film paints a compelling portrait of incitement to political radicalism, as well as the scorching scars of civil war, as suggested by the title; and it's refreshing to see a film that approaches Lebanon's complex political past not through straight military or historical drama, but by using family as allegory, and focussing primarily on its impact on mother and daughter. If that sounds abstract or academic, Incendies certainly feels it at times, and finally it only works if viewed as such - not least because the eleventh hour revelation on which the film hinges (a twist tragic enough to make Oedipus count his lucky stars) would be pretty hard to swallow otherwise.

VHailed as the original screwball comedy and winner of a then unprecedented five Oscars, It Happened One Night nearly didn't happen at one point due to little interest in the script and even less from any actors (Myrna Loy and Robert Montgomery turned the film down). Unable to rely on star power and with a restricted budget Frank Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin cooked up a strong story with witty dialogue to carry the film, and when an 'expensive' Clark Gable and 'difficult' Claudette Colbert got involved expectation - including, reportedly Gable's - was defied. \u000a																\u000a																Colbert's spoilt and rebellious heiress Ellie Andrews is intent on escaping her father's clutches and dives off his yacht in a desperate bid for freedom. Evading him once again by catching a bus (she's too posh for this normally), she falls in with jobless newspaperman Peter Warne (Gable) who, knowing her true identity and having read the headlines, is intent on exploiting the situation in order to rejuvenate his career.\u000a																It's not detrimental to the plot to say the couple eventually fall in love, since there's nothing here that would constitute a plot twist for modern viewers. The joy of the film is watching the couple's time-honoured screwball manoeuvres - instantly disliking each other and constantly bickering and bantering during their forced proximity. \u000a																\u000a																The humour is less laugh-out-loud than pleasantly amusing - the couple find themselves in increasingly ironic situations as they reluctantly, and finally forcibly, break the conventions of their time. The film is pure Depression-era escapism, showing audiences that couples can fall for each other over dunking donuts and that love will always win out over class difference and financial inequality. \u000a

VWith Nicolas Winding Refn's apocalypticepic Valhalla Rising (2009) out in cinemas at the end of April, and the altogether more family-friendly How To Train Your Dragon coming right at us in full 3D a month earlier, 2010 is shaping up to be the year of the Viking - although Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders' film probably has more in common with Avatar (2009) than with anything in Refn's bleak odyssey.\u000aOnce again we have a male protagonist caught between his allegiance to his fellow humans and his growing affection for a perceived enemy - and an initiation that involves the union between man and flying, phallic beast. Unlike Cameron's film, however, How To Train Your Dragon is a joyously absurd adventure that wears its themes lightly. Scrawny accident-prone adolescent Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is desperate to impress his gruff alpha-male father Stoick (Gerard Butler), hulking chieftain of the island village of Berk. During a night raid by marauding dragons, Hiccup manages to bring down an elusive, all-black Night Fury - but when Hiccup discovers the beast still alive but helpless, instead of killing it he offers it friendship and a new tail, and is soon learning that everything that generations of Berk villagers have believed about dragons is wrong. This newfound knowledge may be turning him from zero to hero in his dragon-training class, and even attracting the eye of his hyper-competitive fellow student Astrid (America Ferrera) - but the day is approaching when he will have to prove himself a man by killing a dragon, which is now the last thing he wants to do.The opening scenes of How To Train Your Dragon shows most of Hiccup's village being burnt to the ground in an aerial assault from dragons. It really ought to be terrifying, but Hiccup instead chooses this sequence to introduce (in wry voice-over) the ordinary community life, 'pests' and all, from which he, as a teen, feels so alienated. That he and his classmates are voiced by graduates of the Apatow school of slacker comedy (including Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Kristen Wiig) only adds to the nervy hilarity of it all, as though living with constant danger from above were no different from trying to be superbad in senior high or coping with getting a girlfriend knocked up. Here dragons form part of the everyday fabric of Viking life - although they are not quite as integrated as they were in Cressida Cowell's rather different 2003 novel of the same name - and they furnish a perfect background for Hiccup's acts of teen rebellion and rites of passage. If Hiccup's dragon bears more than a passing resemblance to the mischievous alien from Lilo & Stitch (2002), that is only because both films were written by the same writer-director team. If the Scots accents of the adult Vikings (although curiously not of the younger ones) recall Shrek (2001), that is because this too comes from Dreamworks Animation. The messages, too, about both being true to yourself and embracing the other, are familiar from any number of other children's film titles - as is the focus on the father-son relationship. Even the Tru 3D is, if we are honest, hardly a necessary addition to the film's imagery. Still, it a fast-paced, funny adventure, offsetting its more grounded scenes with some breathtaking flights of fancy - and, rather cleverly for a free adaptation in an age when fundamentalism and secularism are constantly at war, it teaches children never simply to believe what they read.

V"You see someone else, and what the other person is going through helps you see your own life."\u000a Buenos Aires, the mid 1970s. Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin), a deputy clerk at a criminal court, may be investigating the rape and murder of a beautiful young schoolteacher, but he has come to see in the intense love and loss of the victim's husband Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) a reflection of his own impossible longings for his new boss Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villemil), whose high social status, not to mention her engagement to another man, puts her out of the civil servant's league. Aided by his dipsomaniac assistant Pablo Sandoval (Guillemo Francella), Esposito relentlessly pursues his chief suspect Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino), but the injustices of Argentina's political history will help Gomez evade his life sentence.  25 years later, a recently retired Esposito finds himself unable to forget, and so commences writing a novel-cum-memoir about the unresolved case. Turning for help to Irene (now a DA, married with children), and armed with a faulty old typewriter, he sets about finding the right beginning and ending to the "life full of nothing" that he, Morales and Gomez have all, in their different ways, shared ever since.  At the 2010 Academy Awards, Juan Jose Campanella's The Secret In Their Eyes was the surprise winner of the Oscar for the year's Best Foreign Language Film over such big hitters as Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon and Jacques Audiard's A Prophet, at a time when few people had even heard of the Argentinian film, let alone seen it. In fact Campanella's film has something in common with Haneke's, in that both feature an older man looking back upon unresolved crimes in his past and their relationship to the broader history of his nation - but here Haneke's sterile chill is replaced with a rich warmth and humour that are altogether more appealing.The Secret In Their Eyes boasts a breathtaking central scene in which the camera swirls over, around, and through a football stadium as Esposito and Sandoval pursue their quarry amidst the crowds - all apparently shot in a single unbroken take. "There's too many people, this is impossible!" exclaims Esposito, and viewers can only agree, wondering how on earth this bravura sequence could ever have been orchestrated and carried out with such gripping fluidity. In fact fluidity of a more general kind characterises Campanella's deft handling of different timelines and multiple flashbacks, simultaneously driving both backwards and forwards to an ending that is as satisfying as it is unpredictable.  Campanella uses the twin genres of the thriller and the romance, as well as twin narratives of punishment eluded and love unfulfilled, to give vividly palatable form to his themes of memory, justice and loss. Despite the challenge of playing their characters over two different generations, the lead actors show incredible range, complementing their subtle dialogue with looks and gestures that are no less nuanced - in a film where what is unsaid or unseen is of crucial importance. Here Esposito's Olivetti, with its broken 'a' key, comes to encapsulate a story full of gaps, ellipses and missing parts, just waiting to be supplemented by the viewer's own fears and loves.  The Secret In Their Eyes will at the very least engross you with its excellent performances, intricate plotting, consummate filmmaking craft, and its narrative that dramatises the time frozen and justice suspended by Argentina's last military junta. Yet even as the film harks back to a traumatic past, it also looks forward to a better future, in a perfect merging of the personal and the political. For the real secret of this character-based mystery drama is that it is also a national epic.

But just as the show still occasionally counters its critics, so Matt Groening managed to pull yet another rabbit out of the hat. Okay, it has a so-so plot and few major surprises, but then you can say the same thing about many of the best episodes. And The Simpsons Movie is right up there with classics such as 'Radio Bart', 'Homer Badman' and 'Flaming Moe's'.\u000aIt's a largely environmental tale, with Springfield's eco-vandalism in general and Homer's new pig in particular causing so much damage that President Arnold Schwarzenegger (who looks a helluva lot like Austrian muscleman-turned-movie star Rainier Wolfcastle from the TV series) decides to imprison the town under a massive glass dome. There then follows some stuff about Alaska, an encounter with a large-breasted Eskimo and a fantasy sequence along the lines of the one in 'El Viaje Misterioso De Nuestro Homer'. Oh yes, and Lisa has a new admirer, a nice Irish boy called Colin.\u000aAs you can see, the plot isn't particularly clever, but then that's because it isn't terribly important. No, what counts here are the gags, and there are some absolute crackers, many involving Homer's new porcine pal Spider-Pig (or Harry Plopper, as he's later rechristened). This being The Simpsons, there are also a smattering of star cameos, including Tom Hanks giving his best performance in years and Green Day transforming from new punks to a string trio when their floating stage starts to sink, Titanic-style.\u000aThe Simpsons also make the transition to the big screen successfully. With the new medium offering the animators all manner of fresh opportunities, the feature film is right up there with Pixar's best work. Elements that particularly benefit from the change in scope include the 'Itchy And Scratchy' short, which sees the put-upon cat and malevolent mouse take nuclear war to its natural, slapstick conclusion.\u000aAs for how The Simpsons plays at 80-plus minutes, there is a stage around the halfway mark where gag-fatigue sets in. Which isn't to say the film isn't funny, rather the jokes come so thick and fast, you almost need an interval to recover from them.\u000aIn a nutshell: Rumours of The Simpsons' demise have been greatly exaggerated.  Hysterically funny, genuinely cinematic - and you get to see Bart's  doodle, too.\u000aBy Richard Luck\u000a

VIf you haven't seen Taxi Driver, your education in film hasn't even begun.
p532
sg4
VPaul Schrader was in a pretty bad way when he wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver. Reduced to living out of his car, the once hot scribe's poor financial situation was matched by a level of mental decay that reduced him to sucking on a loaded revolver in order to get to sleep. In the midst of this depression, Schrader pumped out the Taxi Driver script, a piece of writing peppered with references to his passion for firearms and his unhealthy interest in pornography. With the screenplay done, Schrader left LA for his family home in Michigan in the hope of gaining both perspective and peace of mind.  While no one would wish misfortune such as Schrader suffered upon anyone, these dire straits are at least partially responsible for the Taxi Driver script remaining unmatched in either the writer's cannon or in the sub-genre of the vigilante movie. Over the years, there have been so many pictures made about edgy outsiders that God's lonely men don't seem so lonely anymore. Add the grit of Schrader's bitter experience to the burgeoning talent of Martin Scorsese and the amazing power and otherness of Robert De Niro and you're some way towards understanding why, 35 years on from its original release, critics and audiences continue to hail Taxi Driver.  New York City in the mid-1970s is a far from bucolic burgh. As whoring and street crime have reached epidemic proportions, so the once proud avenues have become clagged with the detritus of daily life. Through this foul landscape cruises Travis Bickle (De Niro), an insomnia-wracked 'Nam vet completely estranged from modern society. Although his attraction to political activist Betsy (Shepherd) hints at a normal life, Bickle's disdain for the city and its spawn overwhelms him. Come the final reel, normalcy feels like a long forgotten land as Travis becomes obsessed with political assassination and rescuing child prostitute Iris (Foster) from her vicious pimp Sport (Keitel).While it might not contain enough sex and violence for modern moviegoers, Taxi Driver's disturbing qualities remain intact. After all, who needs graphic assaults when you have Martin Scorsese cameoing as a passenger bent on shooting a woman in the holiest of holies. And while the film's sexual content comprises a snatch of the Swedish porn film Language Of Love, the sound of Iris unfastening Travis's zip is as unsettling as a 'sex' scene can be.  With Taxi Driver having been the subject of so much academic study and critical appraisal, it's hard to say anything about Scorsese's movie that's not been said 100 times before. If the film highlights anything, however, it's the importance of competition within the film industry. Sure, the studios have always been at one another's throats for control of the box-office, but for film to flourish, it's the artists who require rivals. When they set about making Taxi Driver, Martin Scorsese was very much in the shadow of fellow 'Movie Brat' Francis Ford Coppola, Robert De Niro was slugging it out with Al Pacino, and Paul Schrader was locked in a battle for artistic supremacy with none other than his elder brother Leonard.   Such skirmishes might sound petty, the product of state-sized egos. But if you look at the films made in America in the 1970s then compare them with the committee-produced products of today, you can't help but feel the artform would be in better shape were the creatives as obsessed with improving upon one another's work as with eclipsing their contemporaries' pay cheques.

VA village in medieval Japan is repeatedly falling prey to a troop of marauding bandits. At last in desperation the villagers turn to an old samurai warrior Kambei (Shimura) to assemble a team of similarly disenfranchised fighters to protect them. This he does, recruiting five other samurai and one untrained renegade (Kurosawa regular Mifune), offering them no more payment than a few bowls of rice per day. The samurai move into the village, where they find their employers initially suspicious, before together they face the bandits as they return for their annual raid.\u000a																With elegant compositions, Kurosawa presents a vibrant story with languid sequences punctuated only rarely by scenes of action - most memorably the magnificently orchestrated climactic battle in the rainstorm. John Sturges transported the story to the West, remaking it as The Magnificent Seven, and stuck closely to the original in the narrative structure and in several of the characters.

V\u000aThere's something almost criminal about the way Spirited Away took over two years to reach Britain after its original Japanese release. In Japan, Hayao Miyazaki is both commercially successful (his films regularly beat box office records) and highly respected (Akira Kurosawa said: "I am somewhat disturbed when critics lump our works together. One cannot mimimise the importance of Miyazaki's work by comparing it to mine."). In Britain, however, his work has barely got more than a few cursory arts venue screenings. At least Spirited Away - which took the Berlin Golden Bear in 2002 and the Best Animated Film Oscar in 2003 - made it. Better late than never.\u000aAfter the stress of making his last film, 1997's Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki had a breakdown and retired. But he came out of retirement when an idea to create another, lighter film began to take shape. Princess Mononoke was an action-packed epic that ranged across 15th century Japan. For Spirited Away he returned to the quieter - but no less serious - themes that he addressed to a degree in 1988's My Neighbor Tortoro. Both films feature a family moving house, girls getting used to upheaval, and elements of Alice In Wonderland. But where the 1988 film used a few specific motifs from Lewis Carroll's book (a plunge into a 'rabbit hole', a version of the Cheshire cat), Spirited Away casts its 10-year-old protagonist, Chihiro (voiced by Rumi Hîragi; or Daveigh Chase in the US dub), fully into a Wonderland, a mystical otherworld populated by animal spirits and gods.\u000aChihiro arrives in this realm by accident. Her parents, heading for their new home, take a road that leads into the woods. Arriving at a dead end, they walk down a corridor through a building and emerge in what dad takes to be "an abandoned theme park". It's something like a Japanese Portmeirion, but eerily deserted. While her parents greedily help themselves to food, Chihiro wanders off and meets Haku (Miyu Irino; or Jason Marsden), a boy who warns her to leave before dark. She's too late though - a lake has appeared, blocking her route, ghostly forms have populated the town and her parents have turned into pigs. She's trapped.\u000aThe only way to survive, Haku tells her, is to get work in the bath house that dominates the town. Here "eight million gods rest their weary bones", according to Yubaba (Mari Natsuki; or Suzanne Pleshette), the witch who runs the establishment. Chihiro makes her way to meet Yubaba with the help of Kamajii (Bunta Sugawara; David Ogden Stiers), a multi-limbed codger who runs the boiler house, Lin (Yumi Tamai; Susan Egan), a serving woman with a taste for "roasted newt", and even a 'Radish God', a giant sumo of a chap with tuber-like appendages. Yubaba is hardly forthcoming - her realm is "no place for humans" - but she's forced to give Chihiro work, thanks to an oath she swore. Chihiro gets work helping Lin. But the management give them the worst jobs - such as assisting a hideous oozing creature they take to be a "Stink God; an extra large stinker at that". It's an entity so foul its smell makes food rot instantaneously, while its suppurations fill the room with a noxious gloop.\u000aChihiro - or Sen as she becomes when Yubaba takes her name as part of her contract - does get by in the bath house, but it's not without further incident. She may lose her identity, but she retains her decency. One act of kindness results in a dangerous spirit, No Face, getting into the bath house and wreaking havoc by playing on the greed of the other employees ("Gold springs from his palms!"). She even gets involved in an adventure that reveals her mysterious bond with Haku. But can she save her parents?\u000aAlthough Miyazaki insists it's not his role to be didactic, all of his work (notably his second feature Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind and Princess Mononoke) has strong messages about ecology and the human relationship with the natural world. But he's also fascinated with coming-of-age stories, notably about how girls (many of his protagonists are young females) can not only face up to adult responsibility, but also how they can become strong, principled members of society. Here Chihiro is forced to grow up fast, but the process, while gruelling, is not without real benefits, as her understanding of the way society functions and experience of adult emotions develops exponentially.\u000aSome aspects of the film are likely to be too foreign for Westerners - we're ignorant of Japanese belief systems, with their hierarchies of entities - but Miyazaki's work has the power to transcend such culturally specific elements. While many of his earlier films drew on European stories (such as 1986's Castle In The Sky, from Jonathan Swift), the folkloric features he reworks are often universal. But most of all, his team's animation - here utilising more digital techniques, while still being grounded in 2D traditions - is always beautiful and, in places, breathtaking. Locations are atmospheric, details are immaculate (you can identify the flower species in the gardens) and characters are diverse. Yubaba, for example, is a bizarre creation, a stocky woman with a huge head and even bigger hairdo; the bath house itself is stocked with all sorts of weird and wonderful creatures, from a Kermit-like assistant, to creatures reminiscent of his cuddly woodland deity from My Neighbor Tortoro, to troll-like beasts that look related to Maurice Sendak's Where The Wild Things Are).\u000aIn a nutshell: It's no wonder the likes of Pixar's John Lasseter (who executive  produced the US dub) are so full of praise for Miyazaki. He's a true  genius, an artist and great filmmaker who happens to work in animation -  a medium often belittled as childish in the West. Spirited Away is  wonderful.\u000aBy Daniel Etherington\u000a

VSteven Spielberg was still in his twenties when he signed up to direct the shark movie that would transform his career - and Hollywood itself. The production was notoriously chaotic yet, with the help of a major marketing campaign, Jaws became the biggest box office success ever, until the release of Star Wars the next year.   The cast is top-notch. Roy Scheider is police chief Brody, a hydrophobe taking up his new posting on Amity Island off America's East Coast. His buddies in battling the killer fish are rich-kid ichthyologist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and maverick fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw). The film has political undertones - it is marked by a post-Watergate distrust of authority - but also owes a debt in its theme of self and mutual reliance to those twin classic 1950s westerns of contrasting political colours: High Noon and Rio Bravo.  John Williams' great and justly revered score is instantly evocative of the film and its power to terrify, and there are several stand-out shock moments and wonderfully sustained suspense scenes. But the film's real master stroke - keeping the monster unseen for as long as possible - was, ironically, forced on the production by the refusal of the various mechanical sharks to function on demand.

V\u000aIt begins with a journey through a man's brain. It ends with a city collapsing to the accompaniment of The Pixies. In between times, David Fincher's Fight Club visits unchartered parts of the human mind and the American underworld. Planes and apartments blow-up, men beat one another senseless, a man quits his job, soap gets made - yes, all human life is here.\u000aAdapted from the cult novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club is different things to different people. What it isn't is a movie that deserved to flop massively on its original release - budgeted at $67 million, it took under $40 million at the US box office. How ironic that a film with an anti-globalisation message should have proved so difficult to market.\u000aOur Narrator (Norton) is an unhappy soul. Stuck in a lucrative but dull job, his unsatisfying consumerist lifestyle has left him unable to sleep. Briefly finding comfort by attending victim support groups, his bliss is shattered by Ms Marla Singer (Bonham Carter), a ball-busting free-spirit. Trapped once again, the Narrator finds fresh hope in the form of Tyler Durden (Pitt), a good-looking, charismatic man who even has answers to the most difficult questions. How do you get ahead of the consumer game? You don't play it. How do you stop being crushed by your employment ambitions? Don't have any. How do you rid yourself of frustration? You join Fight Club.\u000aA picture overloaded with dark comedy, disturbing imagery and intense assaults (the fist fights are as nothing compared to the beatings handed out at Ikea and Starbucks), Fight Club is so brain-melting that watching it more than once is a necessity. Take the character of Marla (Bonham Carter's greatest performance): the woman who comes on like a barmy devil on the first screening seems more like an angel second time around.\u000aAlthough it has the good grace not to answer the myriad questions it asks, Fight Club does clear up a range of issues. Is Edward Norton one of the greatest actors of his generation? Absolutely. Can Brad Pitt step up to the plate come the big occasion? But of course. Did David Fincher get lucky with Se7en? Not a bit of it.\u000aGiven that it is a picture about cruel irony, it's amusing that something as cash-brutal as the film industry could spawn so anti-corporate a movie as Fight Club. Some might argue that the reason Fox backed the film was due to the fact that, under the surface, Fincher's film is far less brutal than it first appears. But as repeat viewings attest, continued exposure to Fight Club only enhances your admiration for both the movie and its message. In no way a secret endorsement of the system, this is a film that leaves your third eye squeegeed clean so that you can face a brave new world.\u000aGot soap?\u000a

VHow many times can you retell the same story? If it's an origin, apparently the answer is "quite a few". From Casino Royale to Batman Begins to Star Trek, we just love seeing a fresh take on how our heroes got started. In the case of The Amazing Spider-Man, they're retelling the story of Peter Parker's first days as a superhero just ten years after Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire's hugely successful version.And during a long opening act, Marc Webb's take on Marvel's famous webslinger struggles to justify the tear-up-and-start-again approach. If we hadn't seen Spider-Man onscreen for decades, then perhaps the refresher would be necessary - but it's hard to shake the feeling that the major beats (outsider nerd, loving adoptive family, mutated spider bite, avoidable ironic tragedy) are iconic enough that they could have been dispensed with in an opening montage. The changes - flashbacks to Peter's parents, a revamped Aunt and Uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen, safe hands in slightly under-serving roles), and a new reason for Peter to visit the fateful Oscorp laboratory - are nuanced rather than dramatically game-changing.But from the moment Spider bites Man, this new take comes alive - and as the deviations from both the comic book source material and Raimi's films grow, it's hard to deny that they're canny and sure-footed throughout. Taking a cue from Nolan's Bat-flicks, there's a determination to show the path by which Peter ends up throwing on a red-and-blue unitard and jumping around the city as being a logical and natural progression of events. Once fully suited up, meanwhile, the new wallcrawler feels far more torn from the page. Lithe and spindly, he dances around the screen dispensing exactly the right blend of irritating wisecrackery. Webb, meanwhile, shows far more of a head for heights than his predecessor \u2013 delighting in throwing his hero (and the audience) through the air high above a New York City that takes its rightful place as a character in the story. Whisper it, but when it comes to the visceral thrill of webslinging, this is arguably a better take than Raimi's.As Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield makes a compelling leading man in a performance that balances muted awkwardness with extroverted heroism. He's also, notably, recognisable as the same person both under and out of the mask - no mean feat. He also benefits from tangible chemistry with the excellent Emma Stone playing a Gwen Stacy that owes little to her comic book counterpart's personality, but is nevertheless one of the strongest superhero love interest roles since Margot Kidder's Lois Lane.The Amazing Spider-Man's biggest problems aren't on the geek-satisfaction level, but are instead matters of more basic pacing and structure. Early plot threads are discarded in later acts, while a promising subplot with Denis Leary as Gwen's police chief father emerges far too late in the day. It also feels like there's an entire middle section missing in which the hero properly establishes his reputation among the good folk of NYC. In the end, though - and despite lacking a villain of real conviction - the film gets by on a heady wave of confidence. It has the brass neck to make significant changes to the established lore and - on joyous occasion - to let its hero truly soar. It's the sort of confidence that could be mistaken for arrogance; but then, isn't that our Spidey through and through?

VIt takes a true visionary to see exactly how the times are a-changing. In the latter half of the 1970s, with only Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) to his name, Michael Cimino approached the Hollywood studios with his pitch for The Deer Hunter. They all baulked, unconvinced that the American cinema-going public was ready to see the recent wounds of Vietnam reopened.\u000a																\u000a																Unconcerned, Cimino secured financial backing outside the usual channels by turning to Britain's EMI, and then took further decisions that, at least at the time, seemed crazy: making the film last a whopping three hours (with a Russian Orthodox wedding sequence near the film's beginning matching the length of all the war scenes in the middle), and placing alongside his established star Robert De Niro an ensemble of relative or total unknowns, as well as John Cazale, whose cancer meant there was a real risk that he would not live to complete his final part (in fact he died shortly after the production ended). \u000a																\u000a																The rest is history. The Deer Hunter swept the board at film awards ceremonies, was a phenomenon at the box-office, and launched the cinematic careers of newcomers Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken. The reasons behind its great success are easy enough to see: it boasts extraordinarily nuanced performances from what is, at least in retrospect, a dream cast; it is technically very accomplished, without once seeming flashy or ringing false; and it manages to root its grand epic themes in a compellingly intimate human drama. The Deer Hunter is, in short, a deserved classic.The film also, in its day, courted considerable controversy, chiefly because of its portrayal of Vietcong soldiers forcing their prisoners (American and Vietnamese alike) to play Russian roulette. 'Hanoi' Jane Fonda, whose own, similarly themed film Coming Home was in fierce competition with The Deer Hunter at the 1979 Academy Awards, accused Cimino of racism, historians denied that there was any evidence of Russian roulette being played in the conflict, while a confederacy of psychologists and media pundits blamed the film for a spate of Russian roulette-related deaths in the US following its release.\u000a																\u000a																There is no doubt that Cimino's chosen focus is on his American characters, although whether this constitutes racism is more open to question - he certainly does not shy away from showing American brutality. Cimino has subsequently defended his film's bhistorical accuracy by claiming that Russian roulette is used on POWS even to this day as a weapon of torture - but it does not follow from this that it was ever used in Vietnam, and the uncomfortable probability remains that the 'continuing', if thankfully marginalised, practice in today's conflicts is inspired less by the realities of the Indo-Chinese experience than by the accessible fictions of The Deer Hunter itself. \u000a																\u000a																What is certain is that the film's Russian roulette sequences constitute an arresting metaphor for the random cruelty of death in war and, thanks to the care which Cimino has taken in building up the viewer's investment in his tormented characters, these scenes are as involving, upsetting and unbearably tense as anything that has ever appeared in cinema.Viewed now, some decades after it was made, what seems most striking about The Deer Hunter is the sensitivity with which it charted the shifting mood of its times. After Vietnam, after Watergate, after nearly a decade of self-examination, anti-authoritarianism and cynicism, when all the old American verities had fallen away and patriotism had become a dirty word, Cimino seemed almost alone in discerning that, in a nation shaken to its very foundations by distrust, there still remained a growing desire to return to some of the old faiths, values and traditions. \u000a																\u000a																His story of three young working-class men from the heartlands (De Niro, Walken, Savage), whose lives are all forever changed by their tour of duty in Vietnam, is a harrowing reflection of America's experience in the first half of the 1970s; but the film's final, ambivalent sequence, in which the two survivors gather at a wake for the third with a small group of friends and lovers and find solace in the words of 'God Bless America', instead looks forward to the future.\u000a																\u000a																Cimino's characters, who are only semi-articulate at the best of times, never actually voice an opinion on America's Indo-Chinese ventures, and it is not clear whether Michael, Nick and Steve go to Vietnam because they are patriots, or conscripts, or because it is in their eyes, much like the mountains back home where they hunt for deer, just another all-male domain in which they can play out their games of cameraderie and machismo. In this way, Cimino side-stepped the narrow ideological controversies of his times, making a film that could (and did) touch both fervent supporters and vehement opponents of the Vietnam War - and the same is true for his ending, which seems to reassert an America that rests on faith and patriotism, even as it calls into question whether such terms can any longer have the same meaning as they did before. It is a mixed message that looks back to all the doubts and disillusionments of the seventies, while at the same time paving the way for the new conservatism of the eighties under Reagan.\u000a																\u000a																On top of all this, The Deer Hunter is at once a war epic (whose focus on the homecoming of De Niro's hero Michael Vronsky evokes both Homer's 'Odyssey' and Tolstoy's 'War and Peace'), a realistic portrait of a sleepy Russian Orthodox steeltown in Pennsylvania, and a story of male friendship that, post-Brokeback Mountain, seems full of unspoken desire and sublimated longings. It is rich, messy, and unmissable.

VWhen the American Film Institute held a survey to find American film's greatest hero, it was no great surprise that To Kill A Mockingbird's Atticus Finch romped to victory. One of literature's most admirable characters before he belonged to the movies, Finch, as brought to life by Gregory Peck, is a walking embodiment of decency and courage. Indeed, such are Peck's dimensions and physiognomy, that when Finch is fighting for justice, you could be forgiven for thinking that Abraham Lincoln had walked out of a history book and straight into a law court. As Finch is one of Hollywood's greatest champions, so To Kill A Mockingbird is one of America's true film triumphs. Its success is in part due to its source material - Harper Lee's best-selling novel tells a fierce story.When a black man is charged with raping a white woman, Alabama lawyer Finch does the right thing and defends the lad. It's a decision that doesn't sit well with the locals who give Atticus every reason to quit. While his young family makes him vulnerable, Finch's determination to teach his children the difference between right and wrong makes him see the case through. Winner of three Oscars, To Kill A Mockingbird is one of those films where all the elements came together perfectly. Besides hiring one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, producer Alan J Pakula secured an esteemed director, Robert Mulligan, gifted DP, Russell Harlan and acclaimed composer, Elmer Bernstein. Pakula also struck gold when it came to the supporting roles, and the cast here do much to carry the film - particularly a young unknown by the name of Robert Duvall.

VFew films really deserve such enthusiastic plaudits as 'heart-warming', 'classic' and 'inspirational', but Frank Capra's Christmas fable is worthy of them all - and more. Small-town life has never seemed quite so appealing. Modern filmgoers are going to have to face facts: we're never going to live in such a gloriously friendly place as Bedford Falls. Because the town, as portrayed in It's A Wonderful Life, no longer exists - if, indeed, its values ever existed anywhere other than in Capra's imagination. Nevertheless, he crafted a magical, uplifting place that, happily, we can still visit any time we wish. The film is a deceptively simple tale of redemption and hope versus hopelessness. James Stewart's George Bailey is desperately unhappy; reaching his all-time low when he sinks into alcoholic depression and considers suicide. Clarence (Travers), an angel as desperate to please as George and hoping to achieve his wings, saves him. In a classic sequence, Clarence unwraps George's life, showing him what might have been had he never existed, and convincing him that life is sweeter than he thinks. In creating this comfortable world in which to exist for the duration of the movie, Capra and his co-writers have fashioned something timeless, where just about anyone can find solace.

The epicness is stated rather that shown, and the world created consequently feels a bit small.

V\u000aHaving cut her teeth on the cult TV sitcom Parks and Recreation, first-time feature writer Katie Dippold lucked out when Bridesmaids director Paul Feig fell in love with the first draft of her spec script for The Heat. And she lucked out big-time when Feig leveraged the box-office success of his début feature to cast Sandra Bullock and Bridesmaids break-out star Melissa McCarthy as seriously mis-matched buddies in this affectionate, female-inflected pastiche of 80s cop movies such as 48 Hrs. and Lethal Weapon.\u000aBullock's tight-arsed New York FBI agent is essentially a loose variation on her Miss Congeniality character, Gracie Hart: a book-smart professional with no friends, no family, no boyfriend and both eyes on a potential promotion, Sarah Ashburn is not a team player. Sent to Boston to investigate some gangland murders, the arrogant Ashburn sparks an explosive clash of wills when she tries to steamroller her Irish working class partner Shannon Mullins, a loud-mouthed local gal with street smarts, a fridge full of weapons and an intimate knowledge of her jealously-guarded home turf.\u000aPolice work initially takes a back seat as the two determined women go head-to-head: Ashburn likes getting inside the criminal's heads; Mullins would rather crack them open. So, naturally, there's a bonding scene in a blue collar Boston-Irish bar, in which Ashburn gets roaring drunk and busts some ill-advised dance moves with the hard-drinking Mullins. After which, they see one another in a different light.\u000aFeig makes no secret of the fact that he prefers broad, physical humour to clever, wordy comedy, so there's nothing subtle about the violent slapstick action or rude jokes: Mullins' graphic description of Ashburn's neglected nether-regions is a case in point. Like Mullins herself, The Heat is initially hard to warm up to, as it tries too hard to establish its belligerent bolshiness and take-no-prisoners crudity; but like Mullins the film is ultimately both extremely funny and undeniably loveable.\u000aEngagingly acted character comedy takes precedence over the nominal action-comedy plot, which involves the usual mysterious crime kingpin and the whereabouts of a big shipment of drugs. One might almost see this as an unconventional love story: two female cops, both in their own way ostracised misfits, start out hating one another, but gradually realise that they have complementary skill-sets and quite a lot in common. And while their contrasting characters are learning to get along, Bullock and McCarthy get to swear up a storm and kick some criminal butt.\u000a

For while Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy make for an engaging mismatched pair to rival Riggs and Murtagh and Foley and Rosewood, they\u2019re saddled with a predictable drug cartel plot that seems to needlessly stretch the running time by an extra 20 minutes.\u000aThe central relationship initially also seems depressingly similar to McCarthy\u2019s earlier 2013 effort Identity Thief. Luckily, after a while McCarthy\u2019s loose cannon (and her The Fighter-esque Boston family) and Bullock\u2019s by-the-book agent start to grow on you, particularly when given the chance to let loose on one another\u2019s fashion sense, hygiene and dating life. Both also get plenty of opportunities to showcase their adeptness at physical and visual gags, while a black humour approach to the action will have many cinema-goers wincing while doubled over with laughter.\u000aThe Heat might lack the sheer balls-to-the-wall, gag-a-minute quality of The Other Guys or even the wacky charm of last year\u2019s 21 Jump Street remake, but it\u2019s both a reminder of Bullock\u2019s comedic talents and one of the best female comedic pairings since Tina Fey met Amy Poehler.\u000aRead more on \u2018The Heat\u2019 and find movie times.\u000a\u000a

V"Who am I?", wonders a pet chameleon, surveying the world rushing past his glass case as he is transported along a Nevada freeway. "I could be anyone."\u000aThis lizard with thespian aspirations is voiced by that most chameleonic of actors, Johnny Depp, and shows a similar range. When we first meet him in his display box, he contemplates play-acting a scenario in which he is a 'sea captain' (like Depp's Jack Sparrow) - and later he will have a desert vision modelled closely on Captain Jack's hallucinatory underworld experiences in Gore Verbinski's previous film, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007).\u000aYet the chameleon also has the crazy eyes and Hawaiian shirt of Depp's Hunter S. Thompson from Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas (1998) - and will soon briefly come face-to-face (or at least face-to-windscreen) with the 'real' Thompson. "I knew it!" Thompson will exclaim - after all, he was always seeing lizards in Terry Gilliam's film.\u000aSo while Rango may eventually target the spaghetti western as its genre of choice, and our herpetological hero-in-the-making may soon find himself 'blending in' as a vainglorious gun-slinger in the dried-out town of Dirt, there is the sense that any genre could fit, just so long as he is prepared for once to commit to seeing his story through to its end.\u000aEven a raid on a wagon in a canyon - a sequence that ought to be pure oater cliché - is played out by a menagerie of desert critters while somehow overtly referencing movies as generically wide-ranging as Apocalypse Now (1979), Star Wars (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981).  In this cowboy flick, anything goes - and it tends to go fast, furious and funny.The western may privilege Men with No Name, but 'Rango' himself, true to his film's postmodern sensibilities, is a man with too many names (he is even "one of the few men to have a maiden name") - and it is telling that when, near the end, he has a mystical encounter with the original Man With No Name, Clint Eastwood's drawling figure (voiced by Timothy Olyphant) should not be riding a saddled horse, but rather a golf buggy festooned with his many Academy Awards. Here everything is an act, and Verbinski is happy to wear whatever shoe matches the performance - especially in the interests of raising a laugh.\u000aRango plays out like a full-length version of the surreal scene in Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain (1973) where the Conquest of Mexico is re-enacted on a scale model by costumed chameleons and toads. In their first animated feature, VFX house Industrial Light & Magic offer a photorealistic (yet highly mannered) microcosm of our own era, as 'Rango' stands off against the forces of property foreclosure, resource depletion and corrupt exploitation, and in so doing, lives up to his own myth - complete with a band of mariachi owls to sing with bleak relish of his evolutionary destiny ("the lizard - he's going to die").\u000aA fish out of water in a town out of water, our swivel-eyed protagonist will come to fit in precisely by improvising and adapting to his hostile new environment without ever sacrificing his peculiar idiosyncrasies. If he, like his film, is an incongruous amalgam of clashing types and conventions, always clad in artifice, then he is also a man (or at least a reptile) for our times, creating his own reality from the flotsam and jetsam of culture.\u000a"We each see what we want to see," as the accident-prone armadillo Roadkill (Alfred Molina) puts it. "Beautiful isn't it?" It is - and thigh-slappingly hilarious to boot, as its state-of-the-art animation collides with postmodern pastiche on a busy road along which wayside legend will always count for more than supposed progress.

VContains some spoilers\u000a																 \u000aIn the final part of what some see as one of the most successful money-making commercial properties ever and some see as the treasured and magical realisation of childhood dreams, but most acknowledge as both, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director David Yates are tasked with tying together loose ends, concluding emotional arcs and visualising a brief coda that required key cast members to age by 19 years. Phew. It's not exactly a case of wave a magic wand and - accio climax! - it appears.\u000aAssessed as a film on its own terms, this eighth entry is entertaining stuff, no more, no less. The Horcruxes and Hallows feel like sub-Tolkien plot-drivers, and we all know who will win, who will die, and who will snog. Fine, job done. But the thing is, you can't seriously assess these films (and least of all this final entry) on their own terms: they're bound to each other, to the books, and to what - for want of a better word - has been called "the Potter Phenomenon". As part of this multi-media, many-headed hydra, how do these 130 minutes fare?\u000aUnusually for a Potter movie, the minutes seem to fly by. Certain sections even feel rushed - not as if their shooting was rushed, but as if perhaps the editors were charged with leaving not a shred of extraneous fat on the narrative (an approach that has been sorely needed in previous instalments but actually could have been fractionally relaxed here). The best sequence involves Severus Snape's back story, and I'd have been content to watch this unfold all day. Before the books were all finished, author JK Rowling told Alan Rickman what was in store for Snape, allowing him to play the part to pitch-perfect effect throughout. Here, his long and meticulous groundwork pays off in a montage of flashbacks and new material of such emotional power it's a shame they don't linger just a touch longer.\u000a Rickman has always been one of the most engaging of the actors  whose characters appeared in all eight movies. But perhaps as much as  the main players, it's the evolution of eternal minor characters like  Matthew Lewis's Neville Longbottom that bring home with a bump how far  this series has come. From a chubby kid in a tale of boarding school  hi-jinks blurting "Sorry, but have you seen a toad at all? I've lost  him! He keeps getting away from me!" in 2001, to a big damn hero with  bloodied brow taunting a grim rabble of mercenaries - "Yeah, you and  whose army?" - in 2011, Neville's evolved under our noses from Billy  Bunter to Braveheart without that even being a main plot point -  something you couldn't credibly achieve in any old sword 'n' sorcery  series.\u000aThe Harry Potter series saw its leads grow up alongside their  characters over eight films: there are no perpetual 10-year-old Bart  Simpsons here. This makes the series unique in film history (though of  course plenty of TV series have allowed real-time ageing) and  contributes to the feeling that something unprecedented is ending.  Whether you are a fan of the Potter films or merely tolerated them  annually like a Christmas visit from cousins you don't really get on  with, for audiences of a certain age, they had become a cinematic  certainty. Maybe you couldn't stand Hermione, but it's hard to imagine  not hearing each year that she's once again excelled in all classes.\u000aIt would be a fitting legacy if one of the many children we're  constantly told have been inspired to read because of Harry Potter grew  up to write something worthy to take its place. It's on this note that  the series closes, with proud dad Harry bidding young Albus Severus  Potter a fond farewell as lil Al heads off to Hogwarts for the first time.  Once you get over the shock of Radcliffe playing middle-aged, it  becomes clear exactly why it had to end this way: it's a hopeful passing  of the baton by JK Rowling to the next generation.\u000a \u000aRead our reviews of the rest of the Harry Potter series

VThe first five minutes of The Social Network lay the film's cards brilliantly on the table. After a humiliating and totally justified romantic rejection, 19 year old Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (an utterly on-fire Jesse Eisenberg) returns to his rooms at Harvard, grabs a beer, logs on to his blog and rants bitterly. In this he's no different to countless contemporary students. The difference emerges as Mark's drunken anger evolves from slagging off the lady in question - "Erica Albright's a bitch. You think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht or because all B.U. girls are bitches?" - to coding a website called Facemash that allows users to compare the hotness of female Harvard undergraduates. It's a tiny step down a road that eventually leads to the creation of Facebook. As Mark steals women's pictures for Facemash by hacking Harvard's online directories of student photographs college by college, the action cuts between this excluded teen's dorky dorm room and a hedonistic party given by the socially connected elite of Harvard. Scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) says "We don't know if this party is real or if the party exists in Mark's head as the place where he can't be while he's doing all this, but I think that - like all of us - Mark would like to feel the way other people look." Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) and Atticus Ross' consistently superb score grinds through this interlocking scene (drink, drugs and truckloads of girls versus coding, computers and pictures of girls), helping bring out all the bitter tensions between Mark's misogynistic fantasy of promiscuous hedonism and the provocative thrill of creating Facemash. This, the work of a single, solitary evening - presented as a lonely, intoxicating power trip - sets the stage perfectly for the film to come.The online politics of relationships, the need to not only belong but be at the top, the excitement of rage-fuelled creation and destruction, where exactly inspiration comes from and whether you can own it, the nature of friendship, the nature of competing truths, the impossibility of objectivity - these are huge ideas and The Social Network tackles them head on with a stylish wit. Sorkin tells the story of Facebook, but the film isn't really about Facebook. It's about what happens when a timeless antagonist - an intelligent and often very funny but bitter and arrogant post-adolescent male - chances to be born at a time and place when his particular set of abilities and drives are exactly those required to found a new nation state of the online world. Eisenberg wonderfully portrays a character of whom we believe all this without question. On the one hand his Mark radiates abundant talent and ambition, on the other he successfully projects the screwed-up bile that stems from his failure to grasp the subtleties of real-world human interaction. He understands the rules of the game, but can't or won't play. Equally, and far more laudably, Mark is also shown throughout to be motivated by a desire to tear down social barriers rooted in tradition and privilege, with Harvard a steaming microcosm of global social hierarchies. Could there be anything more indicative of Mark's Spock-like view of social interaction than Facebook's - and therefore Mark's - choice of the word "status" to qualify whether one is in a relationship or not? Relationships are a trophy, an elusive uncodifiable mystery that this outsider tries so very hard to codify, literally as far as the millions of lines of code that go into creating his social networking site are concerned, but also in the more figurative sense. As more people selectively share more and more of themselves online, this is a subject aching for a clear-sighted, smartly-executed treatment, and David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin have provided exactly that treatment. That they've done so through a compelling human story, expertly acted, intensely re-watchable, and with plenty of LOLs along the way, is what makes The Social Network one of this year's few truly essential films.

V\u000aWarner Bros. Pictures\u000aThere\u2019s no contest. The Dark Knight Rises, which opens next week, is the most hotly anticipated movie of the summer. And yes, it lives up to the hype. But what\u2019s most astonishing is not Batman\u2019s new flying machine that zooms around skyscraper canyons, or a flirty Anne Hathaway poured into a skin-tight catsuit and stiletto boots, or a muzzled terrorist who looks like an S&M wrestler on steroids. No, the most breathtaking moment in the epic finale of the Batman trilogy is when Michael Caine weeps.\u000aWhy? That would be a spoiler. Let\u2019s just say the domestic bickering between Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Alfred (Caine), his paternal butler, finally comes to an emotional head. \u201cSir Michael Caine is always going to surprise you,\u201d says writer-director Christopher Nolan, on the phone from Los Angeles. \u201cHaving worked with him on five movies, I knew he was going to bring something special to that scene. But when he performed it, it was absolutely gutting. We sat there in dailies and people were just sobbing.\u201d\u000aDon\u2019t be surprised to see Caine honoured at the Oscars, or to see The Dark Knight Rises vie for Best Picture. Some franchises simply peter out. Nolan\u2019s trilogy, like the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter sagas, has an engineered momentum that builds to a monumental climax. After Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008), \u201cthis is not another episode in a series for us,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cIt\u2019s the third act in one large story.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt also lands as the third act of a superhero summer, the last of three blockbusters after Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man. As an action movie with physical and emotional heft, The Dark Knight Rises would appear to be the heavyweight contender. But The Avengers vaulted past the Potter, Pirates and Transformers franchises to become the third-highest-grossing movie in history after Avatar and Titanic, reaping a worldwide box office of $1.4 billion. Tough act to follow\u2014even though The Dark Knight earned over $1 billion.\u000aTwenty years ago, who could have predicted that Hollywood would be a comic-book kingdom? Blame it on Tim Burton\u2019s Batman (1989), which spawned a breed of dark, operatic spectacles for grown-up fanboys. Now every self-respecting star needs a franchise and a mask, while comic-book culture ravages the ecology of the multiplex like an invasive species.\u000aBut Nolan doesn\u2019t see his work as part of the trend. \u201cWe never saw our films as comic-book movies,\u201d he says. \u201cThe jumping-off point for Batman Begins was to make a movie, like any other adaptation.\u201d Yet he realizes that Rises\u2019 anchor spot in this superhero summer will affect its fate. \u201cHow it\u2019s going to do, I have no idea,\u201d says the 41-year-old British director. \u201cAll I can do is make the best film I can and hope people go along for the ride.\u201d\u000aThere is a lot riding on it. Everything about The Dark Knight Rises seems to be an escalation of scale. With an estimated budget of $250 million, it clocks in at a mighty two hours, 44 minutes. Half the movie was filmed in the giant IMAX format, while the rest was shot on 70-mm and 35-mm film. Stubbornly old-school, Nolan refused to use digital video or 3D. And he often chose bravura stunts over computer graphics\u2014from men dangling off a plane to 11,000 extras watching a football game as the field erupts with explosives.\u000a\u201cAudiences are ruthless in their demand for freshness and novelty,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see the same thing again and again. They need to see it done in a different way and in a different place. It\u2019s a particular challenge with a sequel because you want familiar elements.\u201d\u000aAlong with Caine, they include Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman who return as Wayne\u2019s two other father figures, Commissioner Gordon and his CEO Lucius Fox, respectively. (\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of fathers for an orphan,\u201d Nolan concedes.) But he has two new divas to play with: Hathaway\u2019s cat burglar Selina Kyle and philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard).\u000aThe Dark Knight Rises picks up the story eight years after The Dark Knight. Having taken the fall for the death of district attorney Harvey Dent, Batman has vanished. Bruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, is now a bearded recluse who walks with a cane, holed up in Wayne Manor like a Gotham Howard Hughes. When a ferocious new villain named Bane (Tom Hardy) lays siege to his financial empire, he hauls the batsuit out of storage. (It\u2019s surprising how little screen time it gets\u2014first we wait for Batman\u2019s return, and later, while Wayne is imprisoned in a pit, we wait for him to rise again.)\u000aScarred by a horrific injury (what comic-book villain isn\u2019t?), Bane is masked by a contraption that pumps him with painkillers\u2014though its main effect is to turn his accented voice into an unearthly growl while channelling shades of Hannibal Lecter and Blue Velvet\u2019s Dennis Hopper. Bane\u2019s dialogue could benefit from subtitles, especially since he has to explain so much of the plot. Batman\u2019s voice is distorted, too, so when they converse it\u2019s like listening to talking dogs. No matter: in the end, it all comes down to a fist fight.\u000aThis time Batman is not just fighting crime, but saving his city from annihilation. Unlike Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker, who picked off victims one by one for sheer sport, Bane is a terrorist on a doomsday mission, armed with a nuclear device stolen from Wayne Industries. \u201cThat was an important part of giving this film the scale it needed,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cWhen you\u2019re just stuck in Gotham, there\u2019s a danger things start to feel a bit village-y.\u201d\u000aBetween the spectre of epic terrorism and the allure of lethal women, there\u2019s more of a James Bond feel to this Batman opus than the others. \u201cBut it\u2019s been there throughout,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cWe\u2019ve been shamelessly plundering the Bond movies that I loved growing up. It would be more obvious if it had an English character at the head. This is a very American story.\u201d Even if this Brit director has stocked it with Brit actors\u2014Bale, Caine, Oldman and Hardy. \u201cYou go for the right people for the job,\u201d he says, \u201cand they turn out to be English.\u201d\u000aThe pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas. And unlike so many comic-book movies, from Iron Man to The Avengers, Nolan\u2019s work is not a maze of jokey, postmodern asides. These are action movies freighted with dramatic and intellectual ambition. Hathaway\u2019s Catwoman may come on like a Bond girl, an agent of comic and erotic relief, but she has a subversive agenda. \u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming,\u201d she tells Wayne. \u201cYou and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you\u2019re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us.\u201d\u000aSound like Occupy Wall Street? Nolan did just that when he used 1,000 extras to film a pitched battle between cops and mercenaries in Manhattan. \u201cWhen we went to Wall Street to film, the Occupy movement had grown up around it and there were ridiculous reports we had chosen it for that reason. But it took a year of planning, and the scene had been written two years before that.\u201d While 9/11 casts a long shadow over Gotham\u2019s scenes of terrorist destruction, the Occupy echoes are prescient. Nolan \u201chad no way of knowing,\u201d says Bale. Filming just blocks from the protest, he recalls, \u201cI was looking at him\u2014how did you know?\u201d Gotham, explains Nolan, \u201cis a parallel world, and you wind up mirroring the concerns of the time.\u201d\u000aOne concern among those who care about cinema is that it\u2019s being overrun by comic-book franchises: the masked superhero has usurped the face of the movie star as Hollywood\u2019s most powerful icon. Which Nolan doesn\u2019t dispute. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely well into a phase where our actors are not willing to brand themselves as movie stars the way actors of the past did,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you look at a guy like Christian, whether he\u2019s wearing a mask or not, this is one of our great actors. But he wants to be different in every film. He doesn\u2019t want the audience to go to a Christian Bale movie; he wants them to come see the character he\u2019s playing. That\u2019s true of most leading men working today. That wasn\u2019t true 20 years ago.\u201d\u000aNolan and Bale say they are both done with Batman\u2014although The Dark Knight Rises ends on a note that will allow another filmmaker to pick up the franchise where they left off. But Nolan, still a force behind Hollywood\u2019s superhero hegemony, is producing next year\u2019s Superman reboot, Man of Steel. The key to comic-book material, he insists, is to treat it as \u201ca source for movies of different types, not a genre\u2014if the comic-book movie is a genre, like the western, the audience will want something different.\u201d\u000aAs for his own directing future, \u201cI have no idea where I\u2019m going next,\u201d says Nolan. Down the road, a Bond movie would not be out of the question. And he doesn\u2019t even rule out 3D, if it\u2019s appropriate. \u201cI\u2019m all about choice,\u201d he declares. \u201cI don\u2019t like being told the way I should make a film.\u201d For one of the few filmmakers who can stand up to the studios, that may be the ultimate Hollywood superpower\u2014the ability to say no.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse Christian BaleChristopher NolanDark Knight RisesMichael Cainesuperheros Anne Hathaway \u000a\u000a\u000a

VSomething is rotten in the city of Gotham. An uneasy peace, founded on a tenuous lie, has allowed business as usual to flourish. And by business, we do mean business: big business, as in "protecting the interests of", cued up visually as the film opens with a dapper crowd being served canapés by waiting staff on an appreciably different rung of the ladder. Later, Anne Hathaway's cat burglar Selena Kyle silkily promises: "You're all going to wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us." Holy Marxist dialectic, Batman! Is this seriously the first radically anti-capitalist movie to make millions of dollars worldwide? Of course not. We're not supposed to be on the side of the bankers here, sure, but a plot that starts off with ideas around taking back power from the few and putting it in the hands of the many is hamstrung as political commentary by the fact that this redistribution functions simply as a villain's smokescreen in a genre that demands the villain be, well, villainous. The big bad's eventual motivations are murkier and more difficult to comprehend, and not just because Bane sounds like a drunk Furby.Much has been made of Bane's distorted speech; it isn't always easy to hear what he's saying (and that's obviously no accident - Nolan has cutting edge technology at his disposal; do we really think the sound mix was a Poundland job?). This communications breakdown is ironic given he is leading a coup based on the mass support of the common man-turned-criminal - he is truly a macabre people's terrorist. Most rabble rousers rely on their ability to communicate simply and fluidly; perhaps Bane's appeal as a boss is that his followers are able to project what they want onto him, hear what they want to hear. They're certainly not there for the competitive health plan; he's hardly gentler with his employees than his enemies.The Dark Knight Rises is most interesting both at a great distance - the big ideas, the sweeping cityscapes, the operatic themes of family and vengeance - and also in extreme close-up. Selena Kyle, Bruce Wayne, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and John Blake (Jo Gordon-Levitt) are wonderful characters I would loved to have spent more time with, just hanging out, hearing them talk, watching them interact. The film is on stickier ground with the mid-range stuff: the minute-by-minute mechanics of the plot and the oddly not-quite-thrilling-enough action sequences (the best bits in the fight scenes are close-up character moments).\u000aThere's also the nagging sense that we don't care too much about what's at stake. It doesn't feel like the filmmakers or audience are willing Batman on to save poor old Gotham - there's more tragic spectacle to be had in its destruction. Perhaps the film's inherent nihilism erodes what ought to be this sense of huge jeopardy - a whole city in peril - replacing it with something a lot closer to Selina Kyle's express desire to watch Rome burn. A film for our times, then.

V\u000aYou have to take your big pointy hat off to director Peter Jackson (Brain Dead, Heavenly Creatures). His adaptation of fantasy's founding trilogy is unprecedentedly ambitious. Shooting all three epic films back to back was fraught with logistical nightmares (all those extras and special effects shots, a punishing 274-day shooting schedule) and commercially audacious, defying the will of original backers Miramax, who would have preferred a self-contained blockbuster.\u000aHis The Fellowship Of The Ring opens with a brisk primer of Middle-earth history, loading the exposition up front. Rings were issued to the leaders of the various peoples of this fantasy land, yet one was created that could control them all - an evil Ring worn by the dark lord Sauron. War ensues, in another one of those epic CGI-enhanced battles. The immense Sauron decimates ranks of men with a single blow, only to have his ring finger severed by the leader of men, Isildur (Harry Sinclair). The world is saved.\u000aTwo and a half thousand years later, the Ring has fallen into the hands of the hairy-footed hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), who lives in the Teletubbyland-meets-Home Counties idyll of The Shire. Bilbo is celebrating his hundred and eleventh birthday, yet he doesn't look a day over 50. The Ring may be evil, but it has preserved Baggins awfully well. Unfortunately, it has also corrupted his soul, and amidst all the ale-and-pie birthday celebrations, Holm switches from friendly hobbit to beady-eyed avariciousness. His old friend and wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) makes him realise it is time he gave up the Ring to his nephew, Frodo, played with sweet wide-eyed pathos by Elijah Wood.\u000aUnfortunately for Frodo, the evil Sauron has returned in the distant land of Mordor and he wants his Ring back. Deathly black riders, Ring Wraiths, pursue him, chasing him out of his home, through the lands of Men and finally to the land of the Elves. There a fellowship is formed, including a Scottish dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), an Elfen archer (Orlando Bloom), and a descendent of Isildur (Viggo Mortensen) to guard Frodo as he quests to Sauron's forge, the only place on earth where the ring can be destroyed.\u000aExpertly tunnelling its way through part one of Tolkien's baggy 1,000-page tome, this first film embraces its inherent darkness. With the film coming at the tale end of a particularly noxious year for the Hollywood blockbuster, Peter Jackson and studio New Line deserve plaudits for artistic integrity, avoiding opportunistic demographic engineering and above-the-title stars. Instead, we have an excellent cast who give their characters a lived-in look, all bitten-down fingernails and back story, with Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn and Sean Bean's Boromir (another human member of the Fellowship) appearing particularly haunted. But it is McKellen's Gandalf that is the truly stand-out performance. Based on Tolkien himself with a tincture of King Lear and a pinch of Prospero, the wizard conceals howling power behind the persona of a genial, weed-puffing college don.\u000aAny problems with the film lie outside the purview of the production. There is a large swathe of the population who will never be able to take elves seriously. The film's intricately realised Middle-earth of hobbits, wizards, orcs, trolls, and goblins has been so heavily quoted over the years, in everything from prog rock to Dungeons And Dragons, that its spectaculars are rather familiar. Then there are the difficulties with the fantasy genre itself - unlike science fiction, which has delusions of satire, sword and sorcery is all escapist power fantasy. It self-consciously inhabits a cultural vacuum, the source of its appeal to its fans, and the reason why so many instinctively revile it.\u000a

The film opens as author Dreyfuss learns about the death of an old school friend. The news reminds him of a childhood adventure that turned out to be the pivotal moment in his life when, encouraged by the friend, he made the decision to become a writer. Chris (Phoenix), Teddy (Feldman), Vern (O'Connell), and the budding novelist, Gordie (played as a kid by Wheaton) set off on a weekend trek to find a dead body that's been spotted by Vern's brother.  Reiner's film drips with nostalgia but is wholly evocative of childhood conversations and trembling fears, peer pressure, boyish affection and the ludicrous lengths to which children will go to prove themselves.   Credit must go to Reiner and King, but it's the kids themselves who lend the film so much charm. Phoenix's performance as an introspective, abused child is a poignant reminder of a lost talent.

V\u000aIf Mr Oscar is a hungry fish, the critical and marketing momentum behind The King's Speech would have us believe Tom Hooper's film is the juiciest of haute cuisine worms, wriggling enticingly at the end of a perfectly poised rod. A dramatisation of the relationship between incurable stammerer George VI (Colin Firth) and self-styled "unorthodox and controversial" Aussie speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), the film is a postcard from simpler times - a from-a-true-story royal postcard, no less. Despite pricey period production (think nostalgically picturesque London fog and Bovril ads painted on brick walls), ample stiff upper lip stereotypes for Anglophile US audiences to lap up and a moving dash of anachronistic psychologising, all the pomp and circumstance is kept in check by Logue's underdog charm.\u000aNominations, at the very least, for Colin-"2011-has-to-be-his-year"-Firth, Rush and screenwriter David Seidler are as good as guaranteed. Bish bash bosh.  Batter those statuettes and wrap em up in fish and chip paper.\u000aTo give the film its dues, the awards nods are as roundly deserved as they are predictable. Firth is reliably outstanding as the taciturn monarch-in-waiting: younger brother to a rather odious, bullying playboy (a not entirely convincing Guy Pearce as Edward VIII), wife to the future Queen Mother (an iron-gloved, velvet-fisted Bonham Carter) and son to tyrannical patriarch George V (an intimidating Michael Gambon). The part of the emotionally repressed, hot-tempered but warm-hearted overshadowed sibling, son and diffident heir is a gift for Firth, and Firth a gift for the part.\u000aEnter Rush as his foil, "a jumped-up jackeroo from the outback", who instantly raises hackles, insisting on calling George by his family nickname, 'Bertie', and insisting Bertie visit him at his ramshackle office ("my castle, my rules"). The film unfolds as a snugly satisfying two-hander, and it's no surprise that Seidler's elegantly witty script was originally conceived for theatre.\u000aWe are treated to montages of the odd couple performing comically absurd therapeutic exercises, Firth loosening his tongue with a tour de force in posh profanity, an eleventh hour tiff between patient and soon-to-be-crowned king and a stirring reconciliation on the eve of war. As Elizabeth concedes, having been instructed to bounce up and down on her husband's diaphragm, "This is actually quite good fun." It's just quite cosy fun.\u000aIn a nutshell: If you don't go in believing the hype, you'll probably enjoy this more.

VOne of Hollywood's greatest acts of alchemy saw a classic romantic thriller created from unprepossessing raw materials: a modest play with a questionable grasp of historical facts, a director with a poor command of English, and a confused cast that was due, at one stage, to be headed by Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan. But it was the film that cemented Bogart's stardom with a role perfectly suited to his new sympathetic tough-guy persona.  Though avowedly a cynic, Rick is seen consistently to be a soft-hearted romantic. Having had his heart broken some years earlier, he has set himself up as a bar-owner in Casablanca, a stop-off point for fugitives from the Nazis during the Second World War. One day his old love Ilsa (Bergman), married to an important figure in the resistance movement (Henreid), comes to his bar...  With its romantic story, the songs performed by Wilson, the supporting cast, fantastic script, the singing of 'La Marseillaise', the climactic sequence at the airport and its perfect final line, Casablanca has entered the popular consciousness, becoming utterly familiar while remaining fresh and vital.

V\u000aIn Mercury Rising, Bruce Willis played an uptight FBI agent who befriends a disturbed and vulnerable little boy. There's a great improvement here as the normally macho Willis lends a weighty yet sympathetic air to his role as Crowe, a child psychologist personally suffering as the result of a traumatic incident in the home is shared with his wife (Olivia Williams). He arrives to help Cole Sear (Hayley Joel Osment), an emotionally fraught boy who has prior knowledge of death that frightens him and terrifies his despairing mother Lynn (Toni Collette).\u000aWith his third feature after the little-known Praying With Anger (1992) and Wide Awake (1998) 29-year-old writer-director M Night Shyamalan had his breakthrough, finding a tone that was to see him through his subsequent films. He positions the thoroughly creepy horror elements within a convincingly dowdy, urban middle-class milieu so that this is not a genre flick but a mainstream drama which ended up with Oscar nominations (six, alongside a slew of other nods and awards).\u000aThanks to Willis' generously supportive performance, well used locations and fine technical credits, The Sixth Sense was a hit, and the knowing but never artful performance by Osment was the cherry on the cake. The peripheral pleasures within this classy supernatural thriller will more than compensate on a second viewing for knowing the shock twist to the movie.\u000a

The resulting film was an artistic, commercial and critical triumph which swept the board at the Academy Awards - it was just the second movie (after It Happened One Night) to win the big five: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Adapted Screenplay.  Nicholson, in the middle of a hot run, gives one of the great performances of the decade as McMurphy, a social misfit who finds himself locked up in an insane asylum. There he encourages his disparate fellow inmates (DeVito, Lloyd and Dourif among them) into acts of rebellion, joyous freedom and self-expression. The authorities, principally in the shape of Fletcher's formidable Nurse Ratched, react with increasing violence to McMurphy's dangerous ideas.  The film remains as fresh, shocking, depressing and exhilarating as when it was released. Its conspicuous success marked the high point of the counter-culture assault on Hollywood that had begun in the late 1960s with Easy Rider. The lunatics had, briefly at least, taken over the asylum.\u000a

VHawks' masterful gangster picture is as startling now as when originally released. Preceded by a disclaimer that there is any glorification of the underworld he depicts, and demanding action from the audience to change the society that breeds such men as Tony Camonte ('What are you going to do about it?'), Hawks shows a desperate environment of rich pickings, easy women, casual violence and the 'rat-tat-tat' of the Gatling gun, and throws in a hint of incest for good measure.

V\u000aIf Oscars were given for most convincing on-screen couple, Annette Bening and Julianne Moore would be a shoe-in here as Nic and Jules, a married couple whose children, conceived via artificial insemination, decide in their late teens that they'd like to meet the man from whose seed they sprang. Bening and Moore nail the rhythms, intonations and body language of long-term lovers, comfortable with each other and far from jaded but also, naturally, no longer in the first flush of romance.\u000aSailing into their cosy marriage, Mark Ruffalo as the biological dad is charming without being too sleazy, and his aura of irresponsibility is finely judged; he's never an annoying manchild, but equally it's easy to see why his grubby-fingernailed laissez faire style has the effect it does on this picture-perfect family. The kids themselves are, as promised, all right, with Mia Wasikowska more effective than she was allowed to be in the woeful 2010 Alice In Wonderland, but Josh Hutcherson slightly in danger of being upstaged by his foul-mouthed toxic best friend (Eddie Hassell).\u000aThe Kids Are All Right is mostly quite cosy, comfortable stuff, with the studio responsible, Focus Features, close to becoming an American version of the UK's own Working Title, home of Notting Hill and Bridget Jones's Diary. The Kids Are All Right is not quite as broad as those films, but don't let the right-on characters fool you: this is a traditional comedy about the tensions between generations and within marriages, and is finally even rather conservative in its resolution.\u000a \u000a \u000a

VBuilding on Steven Speilberg's reputation as all-round family entertainer, and Harrison Ford's post-Star Warsaction-hero credibility, Raiders Of The Lost Ark retreads the Saturday matinee cliff-hanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s for more cynical times, making for a hugely enjoyable romp. Unsuprisingly, that other titan of popcorn cinema, George Lucas, was also in the mix - he developed the script and executive produced.  The director does little to update his source material. The plot is pretty standard get-the-girl-and-kill-the-baddies stuff: the race between rugged archaeologist Indie (Ford) and, intriguingly, pre-World War II ambassadors for Hitler to claim the Ark of the Covenant, believed to hold the Ten Commandments. But he adds a contemporary sense of humour that leaves you breathless at its invention, and setpieces that have an audacity that has be seen to be believed.

VThe picture that effectively introduced the world to Audrey Hepburn, this is feelgood fare of the first order driven by good old-fashioned star power. Hepburn is the poised but pampered princess on holiday in Rome. Weary of her official duties, she bunks off and ends up in the arms of fast-talking newspaperman Joe Bradley (Peck).  Hepburn's performance still looks brilliantly fresh and she gets surprising comic mileage out of her girlish innocent abroad act. As the affair gathers momentum, an initially prickly Peck puts professional considerations aside and allows himself to be won over by her relentlessly cute allure. Their romance is played out against the sights and sounds of a beautifully shot Rome, and in one of the many memorable moments the couple visit the Mouth of Truth, where an ad-libbing Peck pretends to have his hand bitten off. The focus rarely moves away from the stars, but Eddie Albert proves a great comic foil as a highly strung bohemian photographer.

VSiegel always denied that his adaptation of Jack Finney's classic science-fiction chiller was intended as an attack on McCarthyism, although film buffs have always chosen to interpret it as such. Indeed, the film could just as easily be seen as right-wing propaganda, a cautionary tale about the advancing Red menace.   Whatever the case, it is one of the most brilliantly paranoid of all movies, with the upstanding Dr Miles Binnell (McCarthy) in a small Californian town slowly realizing that the population is being replaced by soulless alien replicas born out of ghastly giant vegetable pods.  It's a tribute to the film's alarming impact that the studio decided to append a bogus happy ending, rather than leave it with McCarthy wandering aimlessly across the freeway screaming "You're next!" to the oblivious motorists.

VRent Inception now on Film4oD\u000a \u000aThe Lord Of The Rings ushered elves and orcs into the cinematic mainstream, The Matrix made computer hackers cool and Twilight somehow made fancying werewolves an acceptable cultural norm. Witness the power of film.\u000aNow, with Inception, director Christopher Nolan rehabilitates that old daytime TV soap cliche: "...and I woke up and it was all a dream." No longer a shoddy excuse to wrap up a narrative that's going nowhere, in Nolan's capable hands a dream is a place where real danger, real drama and some of the most elegantly sculpted, visually stimulating landscapes you'll see all year unfold for your viewing pleasure. And there's only one scene where it all looks a bit like a Sony Bravia advert. Impressive. Most impressive. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, a conflicted thief heading up a team whose aim is to pull off a heist in reverse, inside a man's mind. This is a film that benefits from not knowing too much about the set-up before you see it, so let's simply say that while Cobb's normal scam is to extract ideas from his subject's subconscious, here his challenge is to plant an idea. This process is known as inception. He's confident it can be done, but the subconscious is a dangerous place, and like all the best heist movies, he'll need assistance from a crack team boasting various skills.Like Nolan's The Dark Knight, there is no weak link in the cast. It's one of DiCaprio's best performances, but this ensemble thriller is never unbalanced by the A-list star power of its lead. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is wry and likeable as Cobb's right hand man, Arthur, exchanging understated banter with Tom Hardy (Bronson), who is entirely suited to playing a charmingly dissolute English forger. Cillian Murphy, who often seems ill at ease in Everyman roles, is perfect as an elite Murdoch-in-waiting rich boy. Ellen Page draws the short straw as Ariadne, the character frequently called upon to ask questions eliciting explanations for the benefit of the audience, or to provide exposition on her own terms. At least she gets an extremely knowing name. It's Marion Cotillard who provides the creepy heart of the film, the skewed emotional touchstone. To say why would spoil things, but she provides a revelatory riposte to those who have found Nolan's work to date too cold and artful. This character brushes aside the entrancing distractions of Inception's industrial origami landscapes and slices to the heart of a timelessly tragic imperative - the need to let go of love for the sake of remaining true to what made it meaningful. I saw Inception twice, the second time on an IMAX screen where the haunting Hans Zimmer score and sheer scale of the film made a huge impact, and, like a recurring dream, it felt more uncanny on a second viewing. But the love story, embedded deep in the root of what makes the film work, doesn't need any bells and whistles to ring true. Inception is not especially original in its sources: this is all about the execution. This is Nightmare On Elm Street minus the bogeyman, The Matrix stripped of the naff cod-philosophy, with a helping of Blade Runner's existential uncertainty played out in a landscape designed in a partnership between MC Escher and Stanley Kubrick. Like the best dreams, Inception has more resonance than a simple breakdown of reference points can hope to convey.

V\u000aSince it first appeared on our screens in 2005, not much has changed in Sin City. How could it? Basin City is, after all, a locus of the imagination, built on pure genre, a place familiar from every hard-boiled novel you have ever read or film noir you have ever seen - although it has been most directly inspired by a series of homonymous graphic novels by Frank Miller, who here serves as screenwriter and co-director (with Robert Rodriguez).\u000aIn this town, seemingly every man is corrupt or a killer, and every femme is fatale or a whore, and as several episodes are woven around both each other and the three that featured in the first film, you might well become as forgetful of the relative chronology as Marv (Mickey Rourke), the tank-like bruiser whom we first meet flying through the air and struggling to remember how he got in this predicament. He was in the first film too - indeed, he met his end in it - as were several other characters, although not all have the same faces or are played by the same actors, and at least one (Bruce Willis' Hartigan) is now a mere ghost, haunting the troubled psyche of stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba).\u000aThere are also some newly introduced characters: Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the gambler on a roll who is about to be taught by Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) that power trumps luck; and Ava Lord (Eva Green), the apotheosis of cruel seduction whose forward sexuality and frequent nudity the filmmakers are banking (no doubt correctly) will prove as irresistible a siren call to many viewers as to her former lover Dwight (here played by Josh Brolin, in a prequel to the story from the first film where he was played by Clive Owen).\u000aThe addition of 3D to the Brechtian spareness of the first film's backgrounds, to the mannered monochrome occasionally splashed with colour, to the cartoonishness of the violence, and to the archetypal nature of the scenarios and their players, highlights all the more the overt artifice of a world constructed from potboiler literature and B cinema. For this is a multi-dimensional necropolis, full of flat yet larger-than-life folk who collide with each other at oblique angles like the comic book figures drawn on turning, flickering pages. The only pity is that the film comes rather frontloaded, with its most explosive material at the beginning, and no real sense of a climactic ending to give these episodes shape or meaning. Still, there are probably eight million stories in Sin City, and this has been just four of them.\u000a

V\u000a(from left) Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Chiwetel Ejiofor in '12 Years a Slave'\u000aHalloween is almost a week away, but the horror is already upon us. Of the weekend\u2019s four new releases reviewed here, only one qualifies as a horror movie\u2014Carrie. But there\u2019s more genuine horror in both 12 Years a Slave and A Touch of Sin than in Kimberly Pearce\u2019s post-feminist remake of Brian De Palma\u2019s classic. Steve\u2019s McQueen saga of 19-century bondage and Jia Zhangke\u2019s contemporary epic of vengeance in a corrupt China are  powerful pictures that confound us with jarring images of human brutality amid natural beauty. Both will likely find a place on my year-end top 10. As for The Fifth Estate, a thriller about unchained data, the horror is only of the psychological kind. But as played by Benedict Cumberbatch, protagonist Julian Assange could give Hannibal Lecter lessons in sangfroid.\u000a12 Years A Slave\u000aOf the four films, 12 Years A Slave is by far the most harrowing, and momentous. There are still more films to come in 2013, but from where we stand now, it\u2019s shaping up to be the movie of the year. I haven\u2019t seen it since TIFF, but its images have not left me. Here\u2019s an expanded version of what I wrote about it at the time:\u000aEven though it\u2019s based on a true story that happened before the American Civil War, 12 Years A Slave waylays us with a sense of tremendous urgency. I say \u201cus,\u201d not just \u201cme,\u201d because I walked out of the theatre with that weight of collective sorrow you get from a good funeral. Leaving the cinema in a hushed congregation. Afraid to break the silence. Lost for words. Feeling that nothing I could say or write could begin to address the injustice, horror and degraded nobility that the movie so eloquently portrays. But I was left with contradictory responses. You wonder how a movie so hard to watch can be so ripe with beauty: the narrative is gilded with lush Southern landscapes that serve as a silent witness to the cruelty. You are amazed that the movie exists, such an opulent vision of atrocity, yet appalled that its story has taken so long to reach the screen. Not just this specific story, but the story of American slavery. Lurking in the background of so many Hollywood movies, it never been so fully represented until now.\u000a12 Years A Slave is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a free black man in the North, and a skilled carpenter and fiddler, who was lured to Washington, D.C. by a pair of circus promoters in 1841, then kidnapped and sold into slavery in New Orleans. After the cartoonish pulp of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s exhilarating revenge fantasy, Django Unchained, Steve McQueen\u2019s epic is sobering, to say the least. Played with simmering yet titanic force by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Northup is no Django-like action hero. He is a literate, sophisticated man who struggles to defend his dignity as it is assaulted, diminished and ground into the dirt.\u000aMcQueen has marshaled a strong cast. Benedict Cumberbatch has a smallish role as the plantation boss who first purchases him at auction. Although he has no compunction about separating a slave woman from her children, this patriarch\u2014who goes so far as to give Northup a violin\u2014is a relatively gentle man compared to his next owner, an alcoholic sadist named Epps (Michael Fassbender) who runs a cotton plantation. Yet Fassbender makes this monster utterly credible.\u000aAs with Hunger and Shame,  McQueen doesn\u2019t pull any punches. There are scenes of unmitigated brutality, both a lynching and a flogging. Yet despite the extremity of the drama, McQueen has not crafted a black-and-white morality tale of good vs. evil. It\u2019s not relieved by the typical \u201ctriumph of the human spirit\u201d that passes for catharsis in Hollywood. It\u2019s too troubled and complex for that, as McQueen delves into the layers of compromise and guilt slaves endured in their struggle to survive.\u000aNorthup isn\u2019t just a victim. He suffers the more nuanced indignity of collaboration, as he lives by his wits, using his education, while being careful not reveal too much of it. The heart of the narrative revolves around a young female slave named Patsey, the plantation\u2019s most productive cotton-picker, who becomes the target of Epps\u2019 sexual lust. Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2014a Mexican-born, Kenyan-raised graduate of Yale\u2019s film school\u2014makes her screen acting debut in this role, and her performance is a revelation. The movie\u2019s most wrenching scene is one in which she is whipped for what feels like an eternity. McQueen shoots it in a single unbroken shot, not allowing the camera, or the audience, to look away.\u000aProducer Brad Pitt made the movie happen, and gave himself a modest role as the story\u2019s white knight, a Canadian carpenter who eventually comes to Northup\u2019s rescue. But freedom comes as more of a sad denouement than a salvation. The tragedy cannot be undone. This is not a Brad Pitt movie, a tale of a white guy saving a slave; he\u2019s just the story\u2019s concierge. The film belongs to Chiwetel and the remarkable ensemble that surrounds him. With McQueen, they\u2019ve created a landmark picture of devastating power.\u000aCarrie\u000aChloe Moretz in 'Carrie'\u000aWhy remake Carrie? Good question, given that the original movie was so potent, and that Sissy Spacek\u2019s iconic performance as Carrie was so definitive. The 1976 movie that Brian De Palma adapted from Stephen King\u2019s novel has become a landmark of sorts. It\u2019s the original Mean Girls, a cautionary tale about high-school bullying with catastrophic consequences, made decades before social-media shaming pushed the issue to the fore. But if you are going to update Carrie, Kimberly Peirce, who made the Oscar-winning Boys Don\u2019t Cry (1999), that seminal movie about persecuted sexuality, would seem an interesting choice of director. You would expect this feminist filmmaker to take a radically different approach from De Palma, who opened his movie with voyeur\u2019s paradise of frontal nudity in the girls\u2019 shower room. But Peirce\u2019s 2.0 upgrade is not as different as you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s a very literal remake of the De Palma movie with some revisionist touches.\u000aFirst the differences. For those who don\u2019t want to wait all the way to the end for a blast of horror, Pearce kicks things off with a grisly childbirth scene, in which Carrie\u2019s screaming mother gives birth to her alone, and is torn between embracing this spawn of Satan or killing her with a pair of scissors. Then fast-forward to high school, and things start took look more familiar\u2014though Peirce, predictably,  eliminates even a soupcon of nudity in the shower sequence.\u000aShe goes through the motions of making a post-feminist, post-Internet Carrie, set in the Facebook world of contemporary youth. The director dutifully incorporates the issue of cyber-bulling\u2014in the shower scene, after Carrie reacts to her first period with bewildered screams, a cellphone camera captures her humiliation as the girl mob pelts as her with tampons. The video will go viral.\u000aChloe Moretz, who cut her baby teeth as the action star of Kick-Ass, may seem an apt choice for the lead. Yet she faces an impossible task. No one could top Spacek\u2019s visceral yet ethereal performance, which still seems utterly real almost four decades later. (I re-screened De Palma\u2019s film again this week.) And the Moretz version of the character is cut from different cloth. Spacek was a fragile, damaged creature who could see her own weirdness in the mirror. She channelled her telekinetic power as a terrifying force beyond her control, even in the end. Moretz is self-possessed right from the start. She gets a kick out of her powers and works to master them, like a nascent comic-book superhero, doing levitation exercises on the furniture and orchestrating flying objects with her hands.\u000aIn one of the key changes from the original script, she turns her powers on Mom before heading off to the prom and locks her in the closet. She doesn\u2019t just dodge Mom\u2019s mad Christian rants; she corrects her: \u201cI didn\u2019t sin. You sinned!\u201d And in the final act, this heroic, hyper-conscious Carrie takes her vengeance much further than in the original. It\u2019s more protracted and diabolical. Plus, she\u2019s armed with an arsenal of digital special effects\u2014 Kick-Ass Carrie has powers that film technology could not dream of in 1976.\u000aCast as her mother, Julianne Moore takes an even more marked departure from her original character, who was over-played by Piper Laurie. Though she got an Oscar nomination for her over-acting, Laurie\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t hold up\u2014her unmitigated hysteria flies way over the top, as if she\u2019s failing an audition for a Tennessee Williams play. Moore seems to have over-compensated, keeping the character on a low, psychotic simmer. She\u2019s a repressed knot of self-hatred. She\u2019s also acquired a habit of abusing herself by cutting and scratching her skin\u2014some clinical mortification of the flesh. To that extent, she is less of a villain, more a victim of her own self-hatred in Peirce\u2019s feminist-lite paradigm. Incidentally, the filmmakers have also upped the ante of high-school sexuality, adding a dash of teenage sex (as normal dating activity) and a pregnancy.\u000aBut aside from all those tweaks, the new Carrie has been very closely cloned from the old one. Entire scenes, shots and lines of dialogue are recycled from the original. And the structure remains completely intact. It\u2019s as if Peirce and her screenwriters (Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aquirre-Sacasa) wanted to rehabilitate a classic and perform some cosmetic surgery, but were scared to mess with the bones of a story that worked so well in the first place. But by taking a safe, piecemeal approach\u2014and treating the original a sacred text rather than completely reinventing it\u2014the result at times seems weirdly anachronistic.\u000aAlthough fundamentalist Christianity is alive and well in America, it\u2019s much less likely these days that a schoolgirl of Carrie\u2019s age would be ignorant of menstruation. And although bullying is a serious problem in contemporary schools, it\u2019s also a hot-button issue. There\u2019s no apparent awareness of bullying among the characters, who seem stuck in a time warp.\u000aWhich brings us back to the question, why remake the movie at all? There\u2019s a commercial rationale, of course. It\u2019s a property that can be re-packaged and resold for a young audience that hasn\u2019t seen the original. The problem is, Carrie has penetrated pop culture so deeply that even kids who haven\u2019t seen the 1976 movie are aware of it. How can can you shock people when it\u2019s impossible to spoil the ending: the blood-soaked girl in a prom dress is one of those images that\u2019s been permanently carved into the Halloween canon. Even Carrie\u2019s pig\u2019s-blood humiliation does not so tragic, because we are just waiting for her to unleash her superpowers.\u000aA Touch of Sin\u000aA Touch of Sin\u000aAgainst panoramic vistas, China\u2019s Jia Zhangke directs a suite of four stories splattered with vigilante gun violence, not all of it reprehensible. A kind of Chinese Pulp Fiction with a political pulse, it adds up to a powerful portrait of desperate individuals driven to extremes by official corruption and runaway commercial development. They range from a mine worker (Jiang Wu) who picks up a shotgun to get even with a super-rich boss, to a sauna attendant (Jia\u2019s wife and longtime leading lady Zhao Tao) who wreaks bloody vengeance against a sexual predator. As a contemporary revision of the W?xiá genre, these ultra-violent tales of explosive retribution are set against gorgeous landscapes in various far-flung corners of China. What\u2019s remarkable is that Jia partly based his stories on sensational real-life crimes that were well-known from the country\u2019s newspapers. They add up such a massive critique of China\u2019s new Cultural Revolution\u2014the decadence of unbridled state capitalism\u2014that it\u2019s surprising government censors have allowed the film to reach the screen.\u000aFor my interview with the director, conducted during TIFF, go to: Jia Zhangke on violent redemption, censorship and Ai Wei Wei.\u000aThe Fifth Estate\u000a(from left) Benedict Cumberbatch, Carice van Houten, Daniel Brühl, Moritz Bleibtreu in 'The Fifth Estate'\u000aThis breathless thriller that treats the speed of data as a matter of life and death. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Bill Condon (Kinsey, Dreamgirls), this propulsive drama does for Julian Assange what The Social Network did for Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg. It portrays him as a visionary who is pathologically insensitive, a genius with a cruel wit whose single-minded ambition leads him to betray his partners and his sources. But unlike Zuckerberg, who seems to have no higher goal in life that personal power, Assange comes across as a genuine revolutionary with a mission that unfolds like a sub-atomic particle accelerator. He\u2019s a cyber-hybrid of hero and villain. Like his long-suffering accomplice, Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl), we can\u2019t help but get caught up in his vortex, especially when the actor is Benedict Cumberbatch, who so on fire these days you wonder if he\u2019s human. Like the character, the film\u2019s narrative arc of ambition and betrayal is a construct that may be too conveniently symmetrical. Critics intimate with WikiLeaks claim that it is grossly one-sided, as it\u2019s based on Domscheit-Berg\u2019s book.\u000aBut the issues raised by the film are compelling\u2014especially in the frenzied WikiLeaks negotiations with the mainstream press, which is personified by a Guardian editor played by the always-sharp David Thewlis.

V\u000a\u000a\u000aDespite reports to the contrary, Steve McQueen\u2019s Oscar-bait drama is not the greatest film ever made. It may well be the greatest film ever made about slavery, but that says more about the movie world than the work itself.\u000aPlaying real-life free man Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1840\u2032s Louisiana, Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a typically strong performance. As do his starry co-stars \u2013 producer/saviour Brad Pitt, slave trader Paul Giamatti, progressive plantation owner Benedict Cumberbatch, and Solomon\u2019s main tormentor, psychotic owner Michael Fassbender \u2013 who inhabit a picaresque purgatory of almost Dickensian grotesquery.\u000aLike Tarantino before him, McQueen pulls no punches in the depiction and infliction of violence. Quite the opposite. Solomon is beaten until the whip breaks, Eliza (Adepero Oduye) wails as her children sold off. Meanwhile, the scene where poor Patsey (the excellent Lupita Nyong\u2019o) is whipped almost to death by a drunk, ranting Fassbender is so horrifying it eclipses the other 130 minutes.\u000aIt\u2019s an unflinching film, and extremely well made, but it\u2019s also a limited one: overlong, schematic, a touch distant. Sometimes it seems McQueen is only comfortable showing the nadir of human behaviour, something borne out in both Shame and Hunger. And no matter what Solomon endures, he\u2019s never more than a noble cypher, a figure lost in the landscape.\u000aThe ultimate irony is that, even with an incredible true story, a once-in-a-lifetime cast and much technical expertise at his disposal, McQueen still can\u2019t manage to make Solomon a person. Surely we\u2019ve come further than that?\u000a\u201912 Years a Slave\u2019 Movie Times\u000a\u000a

VA modern thriller masterpiece that established intellectual murderer Dr Hannibal Lecter in the canon of cinematic monsters, as much for his manifest intelligence as for his violent and cannibalistic tendencies.  When a serial killer (dubbed 'Buffalo Bill') is on the loose, an FBI profiler approaches the imprisoned serial killer Lecter (Hopkins) for psychological advice on the murderer. Lecter refuses to work with anyone other than rookie agent Clarice Starling (Foster), offering her titbits of information in return for her life story. Her FBI boss, Jack Crawford (Glenn), warns her "Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head," but that's where he's heading. The famous exchange that leads to her childhood memory that gives the film its title begins with him coercing painful reminiscences out of her. "After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And...?" A devious complex character, there's more to Lecter's agenda, however, than messing with Clarice's head. There's the small matter of his relationship with Buffalo Bill, and his plans for escape - which, of course, include him indulging his cannibalism.  Although some claim that the previous portrayal of Lecter (then spelt Lecktor) by Cox in Manhunter is superior, Hopkins makes the role his own. With flashes of urbanity, wit and fierce intelligence he creates an unforgettable grotesque. Against him, Foster is the embodiment of pluck, desperately fighting to understand Lecter's gnomic utterances and capture Buffalo Bill.

VMurray has too rarely appeared in films worthy of his talent. Here his old sparring partner Ramis, as director and co-writer, gives him a part tailored for his ultra-cynical persona. It is a classic tale of redemption, wrapped up in a brilliantly simple narrative idea. Murray is jaded weather man Phil Connors who is yet again forced to report from the annual Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsatawney. Once there he finds himself reliving, seemingly ad infinitum, the same drab February 2nd. It is never explained why this Sisyphean punishment is inflicted on Connors, but it slowly dawns on him that he is being given not merely a second chance, but countless second chances.As well as a perfect star vehicle, the film is a brilliant analysis of the implications of the film's simple conceit. Ramis and Rubin explore all the comic possibilities and also many of the serious ones, while skilfully avoiding mawkishness. Having given up thoughts of suicide after several successful attempts, Connors becomes a skilled criminal, an expert ice-sculptor, a serial womanizer, a gourmand, a linguist, an accomplished pianist, a great doer of good deeds, a successful romantic and, like George Bailey in the not dissimilar It's A Wonderful Life, the richest, most popular man in town.

V\u000aYou can imagine The Lone Ranger's inception meeting at Disney. "I want to make a blockbuster based on a pop-culture phenomenon from the 1930s," comes the pitch. "It's a Western\u2026 for kids!" Absolute silence. "I'll need a budget of around $250 million, and it's going to be two and a half hours long." Concerned faces all round. Some papers are shuffled. There is some giggling at the back. "Oh, and did I mention I'm Gore Verbinski, director of the unfathomably successful Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise?" A beat. "Where do you want your truck full of money parked, sir?" comes the studio's reply.\u000aTonally uneven and with a running time likely to leave little ones saddle sore, it's not difficult to see why audiences in the US left this Ranger well alone. In truth, The Lone Ranger is far from the disaster some critics have pegged it as: it's admirable in scale, features two charismatic leads in Depp and Armie Hammer, and climaxes with a joyous train heist sequence set to the rollicking sounds of Hans Zimmer's take on the William Tell Overture. The problem is you have to sit through two hours of dry, barren blockbuster to get your reward.\u000aBy now, Depp can pull off quirky characters like this in his sleep, but Pirates scribes Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio give Tonto the bulk of the back-story, if not the emotional range to make it matter. Hammer is far more lively as Reid, giving what could have been a bland leading role some much needed comedic edge. Frequently the pair detour to shoehorn in an unnecessary set-piece; Helena Bonham Carter's brothel madam is surplus to requirements, and her shtick \u2013 a gun hidden in a prosthetic leg \u2013 is no substitute for character. Like the Pirates sequels, The Lone Ranger is a movie in desperate need of tightening up \u2013 at a lean two hours it would feel like less of a slog.\u000aStick with it, through the countless flashbacks and framing devices and needless side-quests, and The Lone Ranger eventually endears due to its refusal to pander to the pocket-money crowd. It is unmistakeably a Western at heart and requires all the patience the genre demands. If nothing else, it is stunningly shot and stirringly scored. Destined to be remembered as a Disney misfire, don't make the mistake of lumping The Lone Ranger in with John Carter's lot; an odd, uncompromising film it may be, but it still manages to entertain in spite of itself.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a\u000aYou can\u2019t fault Disney for pitching The Lone Ranger as \u2018Pirates of the Wild West\u2019. But while you can hold a bright candle to that comparison, Gore Verbinski\u2019s ability to imitate the earnest enjoyment of its source material is what really shines through.\u000aThe familiar greed, land confiscation, political corruption, and attempted genocide that come with screen depictions of American Natives vs. The White Man serve as background fodder here. The real story comes with Johnny Depp\u2019s Tonto moulding Armie Hammer\u2019s goody-two-shoes John Reid into the hero he could be \u2013 though he would have preferred his brother Dan Reid. It\u2019s all book-ended by an older Tonto retelling the adventure to a young-un \u2013 a narrative device that could have been chopped off the two-and-a-half hour running time.\u000aJohnny doesn\u2019t take his Jack Sparrow shtick to new Depp-ths, but Hammer feeds off his antics far better than Orlando Bloom ever did. William Fichtner brings a great cob of corn to his savage outlaw Butch, Helena Bonham Carter is effectively distracting as a dolled-up professional \u2018dancer\u2019 and Tom Wilkinson does a good Tom Wilkinson impression. It\u2019s too bad that Luther\u2019s Ruth Wilson is underused as a distressed damsel involved a weird incest-in-law romantic sub-plot.\u000aThe constant wackiness of The Lone Ranger seems jarring in this modern age of frowny-faced blockbusters. Yet the cheesy tone acts as momentum to justify the creative absurdity of its finale, a dual train chase that features all manner of stunts that lean towards the right side of ridiculous. The result is an action sequence so vastly joyous that it nudges a three-star film into four-star territory.\u000aRead more on \u2018The Lone Ranger\u2019 and find movie times.\u000a\u000a

VThis immensely entertaining WWII story about a group of Allied officers' attempt to escape from a German POW camp is based on a true story, even though much of it must have been twisted out of recognition. But with Hollywood storytelling of this quality, who's complaining? \u000a																\u000a																Most memorable is McQueen as the Captain Virgil Hilts, 'The Cooler King', turning in a typically nonchalant performance as the perennial thorn in the camp commandant's side. On the debit side, Coburn's 'Australian' accent is truly horrific. Once the boys have made their break-out, Hilts's attempt to motorcycle himself out of trouble rates as one of the most memorable action sequences ever, while the rest of the movie ticks along just nicely with its finely tuned mixture of humour counterpoised with darkness when many of the officers are re-captured and summarily executed. \u000a																\u000a																Watching the starry cast is always entertaining, and while The Great Escape has little new to say about war, this is really not a criticism.

VDirector David Lean made his name with smaller, more intimate movies like Brief Encounter  and Oliver Twist, but by the time of The Bridge On The River Kwai his epic cinema output was in full swing. The story takes place in 1943, in a POW camp in Burma, where the Japanese are building a railway line between Malaysia and Rangoon. Or, rather, where British Army prisoners are building it, amid conditions of utter brutality and slavery.\u000a																\u000a																For Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) the broad canvas of the war narrows to this particular task - and he and his men pour their energy into it as a means of maintaining their discipline, but also holding on to their marbles. The question is, how far will Nicholson go to protect his bridge, which stands as a symbol of British military efficiency and excellence, even as it makes a vital contribution to the Japanese war effort? In the meantime, the Japanese camp commandant Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) is privately humiliated by his captives' superior engineering skills: the British are building a better bridge than the Japanese Army could - ironically thanks to the extra efforts of the British officer in charge.But further irony - there's an Allied plan to blow it up, which poses a terrible dilemma for Nicholson: will he expose the sabotage and save the bridge, or see it destroyed? As a soldier, the choice is clear, but incredibly he seems ready to ignore his duty to Allied interests.\u000a																\u000a																Whether this is really a film about the complex reality of war, or a melodramatic scenario tacked on to real events is a moot point, but Nicholson's dilemma certainly makes for compelling, spectacular cinema. And Guinness and Hayakawa are excellent as the Japanese and British colonels at odds with each other, but united in their goal of completing the bridge. It's the ironic complexities of the story, together with Lean's trademark epic visual style that places The Bridge On The River Kwai among the best British war films.
